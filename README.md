# PinMAME

*Pinball Multiple Arcade Machine Emulator*

## What is it?

PinMAME emulates the hardware found in almost every solid state pinball machine created from
the earliest days of CPU-controlled machines (mid 1970's) through 2014 (Stern SAM),
with around 770 emulated unique Pinball machines and many more clones/revisions (overall more than 2700 sets).
It is available in various forms:

Standalone Emulator (PinMAME (command line), PinMAME32 (UI))

COM library (VPinMAME) to steer simulators like [Visual Pinball 8/9/X](https://github.com/vpinball/vpinball)

library (libPinMAME) to steer simulators like [VPE](https://github.com/freezy/VisualPinball.Engine), VPX Standalone,
or hardware replacement solutions like [PPUC](https://github.com/PPUC)

Supported platforms: Windows (x86), Linux (x86/Arm, incl. RaspberryPi and RK3588), macOS, iOS/tvOS, Android

Currently, the following pinball hardware is emulated:

Williams/Bally WPC, Williams/Bally System 11, Williams System 9, Williams System 7,
Williams System 6, Williams System 4, Williams System 3,
Data East AlphaNumeric System, Data East 128x16 DMD, Data East 128x32 DMD,
Data East/Sega 192x64 DMD, Sega/Stern Whitestar System, Stern S.A.M., Stern MPU-100, Stern MPU-200,
Bally MPU-17 & MPU-35, Bally Video/Pinball, Bally 6803,
Gottlieb System 1, 80, 80a, 80b, System 3, Hankin, Gameplan MPU-1 & MPU-2, Atari,
Zaccaria, Taito of Brazil, Midway, Capcom, Alvin G. and Co., Technoplay, Mr.Game, Spinball,
Nuova Bell, Inder, Juegos Populares, LTD, Peyper, Sonic, Allied Leisure, Fascination, Int.,

Sport Matic, Regama, Illinois Pinball.

*Note: Emulation is not 100% working and correct for all hardware, but very close for the vast majority.*

PinMAME is built as an add-on to the historic [MAME 0.76 Source Code](https://github.com/mamedev/historic-mame). Some of the original code was altered, and fixes from later MAME versions were applied. In addition, it can be compiled on unix platforms (including macOS) and is (hopefully) 100% compatible with 64bit CPU architectures/compiles by now.

All the historic MAME readme files with all disclaimers, credits and instructions are included for
info on using MAME related functions.

All standard MAME "functions" do work the same way in PinMAME (profiler, debugger, cheats,
record/playback, command line switches etc.).

In addition, there is special compile time support for the [P-ROC](http://www.pinballcontrollers.com),
to drive (at least) real WPC machines with PinMAME/P-ROC, [PPUC](https://github.com/PPUC) and LISY
(Linux for Gottlieb System1 & System80, Bally, Atari, Williams and 'HOme' Pinballs, to drive real pinball machines via
PinMAME and special hardware, see http://www.lisy80.com & http://www.lisy.dev, also README.lisy)
platforms (see PROC and LISY_X defines in makefile.unix).

## What does it do?

Before you start to add the ROMs from your favorite pinball machine please note:

- The PinMAME pinball emulator/simulator itself is not 100% playable. It only emulates the electronic circuit boards and the display(s) found in the pinball machine backbox. There is no playfield and no balls that you will see 'emulated' and displayed!
- This part can optionally be added by using separate independent program packages, like Visual Pinball or Unit3D Pinball, which take care of simulating physics and the 3D rendering of the playfield and all its parts.
- Note however, that you can still activate switches with your keyboard, see the display animations,
and listen to/record the pinball game sounds with the pure PinMAME package itself.

"Supported" usually means that the game loads and the display(s) start up along with lamps etc. All games
enter attract mode and you can use the Coin Door switches to enter the menus.

### Notes

- Sound may not be supported, or may not work properly for all listed games.
- A FEW games may not work or be supported correctly due to customizations of the original hardware.
- Some games may not be fully supported, simply because we could not find full rom sets, so some chips remain undumped.

## Simulation?

For many games there is a ball simulator which you can use to simulate "playing" the game. The simulator allows you to use the keyboard to make shots/hit targets with your virtual/invisible pinball..

Essentially, it triggers the correct switches depending on where the balls are located. You can program a simulator for your own favourite game if you know a bit of programming and a lot about the game. If you are intersted let us know and we'll try to explain how to do it.

For more information, please refer to [simulation.txt](release/simulation.txt) for instructions on using the pinball simulator built into PinMAME! Many games are not fully simulated, but some have at least preliminary simulator support!

# Note from the PinMAME Development team

We're working hard to improve this great emulator, and welcome your feedback!! Please do not hesitate to contact us with questions, bug reports, suggestions, code patches, whatever!
