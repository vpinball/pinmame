Bugs in Pinmame that we are aware of:
-------------------------------------
(Note: Many of these bugs have been extremely difficult to track down and fix, 
       so it might be awhile before they can be corrected!)

 #1) Williams/Bally WPC: DCS sound still has some problems.
     (Don't use full volume (29-31) to avoid static noise)

 #2) Not all Williams/Bally WPC functions are implemented in PinMAME.
     The most important (?!) functions missing are the ticket dispenser,
     and accurate real time clock emulation (current rtc functionality is a workaround).

 #3) The WPC printer function is only tested with default settings.
     The printout will probably not work with other settings.

 #4) Saucer LEDs not implemented in AFM.

 #5) The name and year for each game were taken from the Internet Pinball Database
     (http://www.lysator.liu.se/pinball/IPD), and may not be 100% accurate!

 #6) Dip switches do not work for Williams System 3-6.

 #7) Data East/Sega/Stern DMD timing is not 100% accurate.

 #8) Volume issues with BSMT games; most of them are too low.

 #9) Extremely poor performance on multiprocessor systems.

#10) Gottlieb System 3 percussive sounds might still have some timing issues

#11) Sound gets cut off in Alvin G games sometimes, and some weird notes in World Tour occasionally

#12) Some Bally games using the 6803 processor don't work correctly.

#13) Switch problems with Dataeast Playboy and the Grotto/VUK

#14) Occasional pops/clicks on Capcom sound

#15) Some games have no sound emulated, but the core prevents us from using the GAME_NO_SOUND flag.
