Bugs in Pinmame that we are aware of:
-------------------------------------
(Note: Many of these bugs have been extremely difficult to track down and fix, 
       so it might be awhile before they can be corrected!)

 #1) Williams/Bally WPC: DCS sound still has some problems.
     (Don't use full volume (29-31) to avoid static noise)

 #2) Not all Williams/Bally WPC functions are implemented in PinMAME.
     The most important (?!) functions missing are the ticket dispenser,
     and accurate real time clock emulation (current rtc functionality is a workaround).

 #3) The WPC printer function is only tested with default settings.
     The printout will probably not work with other settings.

 #4) Saucer LEDs not implemented in AFM.

 #5) The Williams/Bally WPC CVSD speech seems to have a different pitch
     than the real game. A strange thing is that the speech works better
     when background music is playing.

 #6) The name and year for each game were taken from the Internet Pinball Database
     (http://www.lysator.liu.se/pinball/IPD), and may not be 100% accurate!

 #7) Some games have custom AlphaNumeric layouts which may not yet be supported.

 #8) Comma issues with Williams System 9 and Bally-6803.

 #9) Dip switches do not work for Williams System 3-6.

#10) System 7 games using a speech board do not work properly.

#11) Data East/Sega/Stern DMD support is not 100% accurate.

#12) DMD / sound issues on numerous Gottlieb System 3 games.

#13) Volume issues with BSMT games; most of them are too low.

#14) Following DCS Games have sound issues:
     a) Indy 500 - Sound dies on ball 2
     b) STTNG - sound stops for extra ball.
     c) The Shadow - Sound stops on every ball except the first until a trigger is hit.
     d) Judge Dredd - Sound volume varies between different balls.

#15) Multiprocessor support does not work well/if at all.

#16) DCS playback appears to be warped on Windows XP.
