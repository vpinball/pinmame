Important steps to take before a release:

- check out EVERYTHING again. Update the pinmame folder, remove sticky tags, create subfolders.
- check whatsnew.txt" if nobody was forgotten concerning contributions, bugs fixes, and so on. Check the date in all .txt files!
- remove the entire obj folder preferrably. Only this way you may ensure nothing was forgotten!
- remove the DEBUG define in the makefile!
- execute "make" to build pinmamew.
- execute "make -f pinmame32.mak" to build pinmame32.
- edit "src/version.c" for the correct version number
- edit "src/win32com/VPinMAME.cpp" for the desired release date
- edit "src/win32com/VPinMAME.rc" for the correct version number and build (MinDependency)
- build VPinMAME.DLL
- edit "src/instvpm/InstallVPinMAME.rc" for the correct version number and build (Release)
- build InstallVPinMAME.exe

If anything of the above fails, forget about a release and correct the errors first!
If it worked out ok, however, do a release!

- Pack everything together nicely, using max. compression
- Upload the zips to pinmame.com, update the news & download pages.
- Release it to shivasite's upload page, and tell all the forum people what has happened!
- Shut down your computer! Go and have a drink. You deserve one now!
- 12 hours later, check back the forum for the first terrible errors we forgot to fix!
