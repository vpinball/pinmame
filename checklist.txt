Important steps to take before a release:

- check out EVERYTHING again. Update the pinmame folder, remove sticky tags, create subfolders.
- check "whatsnew.txt" if nobody was forgotten concerning contributions, bugs fixes, and so on.
- check the date and version in all .txt files!
- remove the entire obj folder preferrably. Only this way you may ensure nothing was forgotten!
- remove the DEBUG define in the makefile (which is probably not there anyway)!
- edit "src/version.c" for the correct version number
- edit "src/ui/PinMAME32.rc" for the correct version numbers
- edit "src/win32com/VPinMAME.cpp" for the desired release date
- edit "src/win32com/VPinMAME.rc" for the correct version number and build (MinDependency)
- execute "mingw32-make" to build PinMAME.
- Make sure to regenerate gamelist and include it (I believe it's regenerated automatically on a build)
- execute "mingw32-make WINUI=1 SUFFIX=32" to build PinMAME32.
- build VPinMAME.DLL
- MAKE SURE STERN GAMES CANNOT WORK, and that TEST_STERN_GAMES FLAG, NO_TIME_LIMIT are not defined!
- Make sure all default folders are included in the VPM zip
  (these are: artwork, cfg, hi, ini, inp, memcard, nvram, roms, samples, snap, sta, wavefile)
- Make sure MAME license is in all released zips
- *********************************************
- (Only necessary if the installer has changed)
   - edit "src/instvpm/InstallVPinMAME.rc" for the correct version number and build (Release)
   - build InstallVPinMAME.exe

If anything of the above fails, forget about a release and correct the errors first!
If it worked out ok, however, do a release!

- Pack everything together nicely, using max. compression
- Upload the zips to pinmame.com, update the news & download pages.
- Release it to VPForums' upload page, and tell all the forum people what has happened!
- Shut down your computer! Go and have a drink. You deserve one now!
- 12 hours later, check back the forum for the first terrible errors we forgot to fix!
