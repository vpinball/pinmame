****** As of Version 3.7 (XX XXth, 2025) ******

Major bugs in PinMAME that we are aware of:
-------------------------------------------

 #1) Not all Williams/Bally WPC functions are implemented in PinMAME.
     The most important (?!) functions missing are the ticket dispenser,
     and accurate real time clock emulation (current rtc functionality is a workaround).

 #2) The WPC printer function is only tested with default settings.
     The printout will probably not work with other settings.

 #3) The name and year for each game were taken from the Internet Pinball Database
     (http://www.ipdb.org) OR from supposedly more accurate personal research/sources, and so may not be 100% accurate!

 #4) Occasional pops/clicks on Capcom sound.

 #5) Occasional pops/clicks/crackling on Whitestar II sound, only on high volume levels.
     (~24 and above, for example on Nascar and Grand Prix, or even ~20 on LOTR, so avoid this)
     This seems to happen on real machines (verified on 2 different Grand Prix pinballs), too.

 #6) Some Data East have slow DMD startups (Star Wars,...), Sega 192x64 timing is not 100% accurate and 
     sometimes shows startup screen, Alvin G. has timings issues resulting in some flicker.

 #7) Sound gets cut off in Alvin G games sometimes, and some weird notes in World Tour occasionally.

 #8) Slugfest will work with "pinmame -cheat sf_l1". Same goes for Theatre Of Magic home version (tom_14h(c)).
     Alternately, check the "skip pinball startup test" in vpm.

 #9) GTS80S DAC sound is off for most of the sound effects.

#10) Some setups crash when using the AT91 JIT compiled code (e.g. Whitestar II and SAM), disable AT91 JIT
     by setting "at91jit" to 0 in the registry.

#11) AT91 JIT is 32-bit and x86 only. The non-JIT core doesn't have tight IRQ timing that may cause emulation issues.
     It would be possible to tighten up the timing in the interpreted core, but it causes a huge performance hit
     (have to keep checking on memory writes whether an IRQ needs to fire).
