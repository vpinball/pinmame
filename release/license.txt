IMPORTANT NOTE:
---------------

As of May 2019, we, the PinMAME team, are working on replacing
the inherited 'old MAME' license (listed directly below) by
the 3-Clause BSD License (which is listed at the very end of this file),
similar to the achievement of the current MAME team.

Each source file that is already under the BSD-3-Clause will have its
very first line marked with
// license:BSD-3-Clause
Every file that doesn't, will stay (for now) under the 'old MAME' license.

I. Purpose
----------
   PinMAME is strictly a non-profit project. Its main purpose is to be a reference
   to the inner workings of the emulated arcade machines. This is done for
   educational purposes and to prevent many historical games from sinking into
   oblivion once the hardware they run on stops working. Of course to preserve
   the games, you must also be able to actually play them; you can consider
   that a nice side effect.
   It is not our intention to infringe on any copyrights or patents on the
   original games. All of PinMAME's source code is either our own or freely
   available. To operate, the emulator requires images of the original ROMs
   from the arcade machines, which must be provided by the user. No portion of
   the original ROM codes are included in the executable.

II. Cost
--------
   PinMAME is free. Its source code is free. Selling either is not allowed.

III. ROM Images
---------------
   ROM images are copyrighted material. Most of them cannot be distributed
   freely. Distribution of PinMAME on the same physical medium as illegal copies
   of ROM images is strictly forbidden.
   You are not allowed to distribute PinMAME in any form if you sell, advertise,
   or publicize illegal CD-ROMs or other media containing ROM images. This
   restriction applies even if you don't make money, directly or indirectly,
   from those activities. You are allowed to make ROMs and PinMAME available for
   download on the same website, but only if you warn users about the ROMs's
   copyright status, and make it clear that users must not download ROMs unless
   they are legally entitled to do so.

IV. Source Code Distribution
----------------------------
   If you distribute the binary (compiled) version of PinMAME, you should also
   distribute the source code. If you can't do that, you must provide a link
   to a site where the source can be obtained.

V. Distribution Integrity
-------------------------
   This chapter applies to the official PinMAME distribution. See below for
   limitations on the distribution of derivative works.
   PinMAME must be distributed only in the original archives. You are not allowed
   to distribute a modified version, nor to remove and/or add files to the
   archive.

VI. Reuse of Source Code
--------------------------
   This chapter might not apply to specific portions of PinMAME (e.g. CPU
   emulators) which bear different copyright notices.
   The source code cannot be used in a commercial product without the written
   authorization of the authors. Use in non-commercial products is allowed, and
   indeed encouraged.  If you use portions of the PinMAME source code in your
   program, however, you must make the full source code freely available as
   well.
   Usage of the _information_ contained in the source code is free for any use.
   However, given the amount of time and energy it took to collect this
   information, if you find new information we would appreciate if you made it
   freely available as well.

VII. Derivative Works
---------------------
   Derivative works are allowed, provided their source code is freely
   available. However, these works are discouraged. PinMAME is a continuously-
   -evolving project. It is in your best interests to submit your contributions
   to the PinMAME development team, so they may be integrated into the main
   distribution.
   There are some specific modifications to the source code which go against
   the spirit of the project. They are NOT considered a derivative work, and
   distribution of executables containing them is strictly forbidden. Such
   modifications include, but are not limited to:
   - enabling games that are disabled
   - changing the ROM verification commands so that they report missing games
   - removing the startup information screens
   If you make a derivative work, you are not allowed to call it PinMAME. You must
   use a different name to make clear that it is a PinMAME derivative, not an
   official distribution from the PinMAME team. Simply calling it PinMAME followed or
   preceded by a punctuation mark (e.g. PinMAME+) is not sufficient. The name must
   be clearly distinct (e.g. REPinMAME). The version number must also match the
   number of the official PinMAME version from which you derived your version.
