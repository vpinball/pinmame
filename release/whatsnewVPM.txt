What's new in Visual PinMAME:
-----------------------------
(see whatsnew.txt for the PinMAME core changes!)


Version 3.3 (X X, 2020) - ""
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New logos by tictox

- If you create a VPMAlias.txt file in the VPinMAME folder, it will alias an input rom name to the specified (real) rom. Format example:
   mytallica,mtl_180hc
   myacdc,acd_170hc
  This can be used to allow to use different PUP or DOF profiles per game (for reskins and such).

- fix the additional .raw/non-averaged file output dumping of GTS3 DMDs

Version 3.2 (October 6th, 2019) - "Sounds good II"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change the default of the 'ddraw' option to 0, which means that the faster (but less compatible nowadays) Direct Draw implementation of the window display is by default disabled

- Extend builtin alternate sound file support (Sound Mode 1) with a new CSV file-format

  Currently specified 8 fields/columns should have a standard order. But in order to be extensible, the first row must always contain all column names:
   "ID","CHANNEL","DUCK","GAIN","LOOP","STOP","NAME","FNAME"
  (So put this definition above as-is into the first line of the CSV)
  Possible future extensions could be:
   "GROUP","SHAKER","SERIAL"

  Then for each sound/line:
   ID: hexadecimal integer (as string) representing the soundboard command (format e.g. "0x10e"), technical ID as it comes from the MPU.
   CHANNEL: use specified channel for the sample. If something is already playing on that channel it will be stopped. Typical channel assignment should be 0: background music, 1: short music snippets, that interrupt or end the background music, everything else (2..15): arbitrary channels. If field is empty, any free channel (2..15) is used.
   DUCK: reduce volume of the background music when playing the sample. Range 0-100 (i.e. percentage).
   GAIN: increase or reduce volume of the sample. Range 0-100. 50 leaves the sample volume as-is (it's recommended to not go over 50 to avoid sample clamping/distortion).
   LOOP: loop the sample this many times. Range 0-100, where 100 represents endless looping of the sample.
   STOP: stop playback of background music. Can be 0 or 1.
   NAME: string, descriptive/internal name of the sample.
   FNAME: string, actual filepath/filename of the sample. Can contain any path prefixes if one likes to organize sound files in directories.
  The only fields that need to be specified are id, name and fname, the rest can optionally be left empty and will be filled in with defaults.

  If the table contains more than one record for a certain ID, the sound engine will pick one of these randomly. These same IDs must be grouped together one after another in a sequence.

  Note that the old folder based structure is still fully supported for backwards compatibility

- Add Whitestar support to the builtin alternate sound file support (Sound Mode 1)

- New (backwards compatible) parameter to allow for mech configuration/specifying an initial position, instead of always loading it from NVRAM
  Add special "handlemech" modes to Bride of Pinbot (bop_l7)
  -1: Reset Bride of Pinbot's face to 0 for consistent startup behavior, but then disable internal mech
  -2: Reset face and continue using internal mech

- Allow window position (x,y) to be less than 0 in cabinet mode, so primary monitor can be put "below" the DMD monitor

- Add additional .raw/non-averaged file output if dumping DMD frames from GTS3 and WPC machines
- Improve timing precision of DMD frame dumps

- Fix for external dmddevice(64).dll: map GEN_GTS80B to _2x20Alpha layout
- Also introduce new function to dmddevice interface: void Render_PM_Alphanumeric_Dim_Frame(layout_t layout, const UINT16 *const seg_data, const char *const seg_dim, const UINT16 *const seg_data2); which includes dimming of segments
- Also (optionally) extend dmddevice interface (with noOfRawFrames and rawbuffer):
   void Render_16_Shades_with_Raw(UINT16 width, UINT16 height, UINT8 *currbuffer, UINT32 noOfRawFrames, UINT8 *rawbuffer);
   void Render_4_Shades_with_Raw (UINT16 width, UINT16 height, UINT8 *currbuffer, UINT32 noOfRawFrames, UINT8 *rawbuffer);

- In addition add support for a secondary external DMD device dll with (for now) the same interface as dmddevice(64).dll: dmdscreen(64).dll (i.e. used to drive PUP at the moment)

- update BASS library to 2.4.14

Version 3.1 (July 29th, 2018) - "Flippin' fast"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Switch to VS2015 for the release builds (tested in the wild and seemingly faster, thanks to CarnyPriest)

- RawDmdPixels and RawDmdColoredPixels will now work correctly for Strikes N' Spares

Version 3.0 (December 24th, 2017) - "11 years in the making"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Extend and update some parts of the .txt documentation files

- New method for the Controller object:
	HRESULT SoundMode([out, retval] int *pVal); - Get sound processing mode, e.g. 0 = standard builtin PinMAME emulation, 1 = builtin alternate sound file support, 2 = external pinsound, 3 = external pinsound + psrec sound recording
	HRESULT SoundMode([in] int newVal); - Set sound processing mode, e.g. 0 = standard builtin PinMAME emulation, 1 = builtin alternate sound file support, 2 = external pinsound, 3 = external pinsound + psrec sound recording

Version 2.9 (June 11th, 2017) - "Attack of the clones"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- No interface changes, refer to whatsnew.txt for PinMAME changes

Version 2.8b (December 29th, 2016)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Expose new option in UI: Resampling Quality, to choose between fast performance/low quality (0) and normal (1)

Version 2.8 (December 24th, 2016) - "Sounds good"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- To enable the new modulated/multi-level flasher support (see whatsnew.txt), set SolMask to 2

- New, generalized external DMD handling via a separate dmddevice.dll instead of the define hell
  This also allows to drive any kind of virtual or real DMD via this new interface (see ext\dmddevice\dmddevice.h)
  For now, Visual PinMAME ships with four different dll packages for PinDMD1/2/3 and Pin2DMD, so pick the one that you need
  NOTE: In case you experience problems on Windows 7 ("No DMD device driver found"), try installing: http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=217865

Version 2.7 (June 08th, 2016) - "Alive and kicking"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New option for the DMD window: DMD opacity

- New option for the sound processing: Sound Mode, where:
  0 = standard builtin PinMAME emulation
  1 = builtin alternate sound file support
      (store the alternate sound files in a PinSound-like directory structure (incl. textfiles for ducking and gain),
       within a new PinMAME directory subfolder 'altsound' and there within the machines shortname subfolder,
       e.g. for ij_l7: 'C:\PinMAME\altsound\ij_l7\'
       or for an example alternate sound file for tz_94h: 'C:\PinMAME\altsound\tz_94h\jingle\000064-load_gumball_pt_1\load_gum__LEGACY.ogg')
  2 = external pinsound, 3 = external pinsound + psrec sound recording
      (must have PinSound Studio 0.7 or newer running at the same time:
       make sure that the windows permissions match between PinSound Studio and Visual PinMAME/Pinball, e.g.
       if one is using admin permissions when running, then both need to be started with that (or the other way round))
  (needs VPINMAME_ALTSOUND (also requires bass.lib/.dll) and/or VPINMAME_PINSOUND defined when compiling)

- New methods for the Controller object:
	HRESULT NVRAM(/*[out, retval]*/ VARIANT *pVal); - Get the full NVRAM of the emulation (e.g. high scores, settings, etc. as a binary blob of 8bit values) 
	HRESULT ChangedNVRAM(/*[out, retval]*/ VARIANT *pVal); - Get only the NVRAM parts that have changed since last call (similar to ChangedLamps), first dimension has the location, second the new value (only 8 bits are valid), third the previous value (only 8 bits are valid)
  (See for example https://github.com/tomlogic/pinmame-nvram-maps for some machines NVRAM mappings)

- Add 'Restore window position' to menu

- PinDMD 3 handling
  (see pindmd.h to change defines when compiling, also requires pindmd.lib/.dll)

Version 2.6 (December 24, 2015) - "The team awakens"
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New specialized options for Cabinet support, PinDMD 2 handling (for PinDMD 1 Support, see below) and 4-Color support for DMDs,
  so please setup the default options again after installation!

- Improved support for PinDMD over the last 'official' PinDMD build by russdx:
  better 192x64 rescale, support for 256x64 and better support for AlvinG.

- If you execute Controller.Run without a parent window,
  VPM will now search for a running VPPlayer-Window and use that if found
- just before the VPM window becomes visible it is checked if the parent window is present and visible. If it's
  not visible VPM will wait until it becomse visible (or a timeout of one second times out). Once the
  parent window is visible it will be set as the active and foreground window
- selecting the vpm display and pressing escape will cause an error - known issue

Version 1.52 (August 1th, 2005)
-------------------------------
- Added an easter egg screen: THANK YOU GUYS!
- Controller.Hidden fixed

Version 1.51 (January 11, 2005)
-------------------------------
- New properties for the Controller object:
    - Controller.Game: An abbreviation for Controller.Game(Controller.GameName).
      It returns the game object for the current game. It's now a bit easier
      for a script to make game specific settings. You don't have to use the "GameName".
      Example: Controller.Game.Settings.Value("dmd_pos_x") = 20
    - Controller.MechSamples(bool): Enables the samples for mechanical devices (flippers, bumpers etc).
      Sound-board specific samples will still be played (if not disabled by dip switches for the game).
      This setting is not sticky and will be reset to "false" when a new game name is set.
      An assignment will only have an effect if done before "Controller.Run".
- New methods for the controller object:
    - Controller.GetWindowRect(hWnd): Returns an array of four integer values (0-3)
      which holds the coordinates (left, top, right, bottom)
      of the window with the handle 'hWnd' in screen coordinates.
      If 'hwnd' is absent or an invalid window handle the coordinates of the screen will be returned.
    - Controller.GetClientRect(hWnd): Returns an array of four integer values (0-3)
      which holds the client area coordinates (left, top, right, bottom)
      of the window with the handle 'hWnd' in screen coordinates.
      If 'hwnd' is absent, or an invalid window handle, the coordinates of the screen will be returned.
- New method for Game.Settings:
    - Game.Settings.SetDisplayPosition x, y, hWnd: Moves the display to position (x:y).
      If "hWnd" is present and a valid window handle, the move is relative to the client position of the window.
      Otherwise it will be positioned relative to the upper left corner of the screen.
- Controller.SetDisplayPosition is fixed and works as desired now.
  Nevertheless, this method is deprecated, so please use the function as described above!
- The display window can be moved to every x position by now (not just to multiples of 16 pixels as before)
- While moving the display, it made short jumps if the title and/or the border was visible; this bug is gone now.
- Changed the warning message on the "Game Info" dialog:
  When starting a game, the sound processor(s) will be disabled if a sound rom is missing;
  the new warning message will reflect this behaviour.
- Switching from full-screen mode back to windowed mode (Alt+Enter) will restore the desktop background.
- Improved initializing of the VPM display:
  It will always become visible at the right position, and will always be the topmost window
- If a valid handle to the "parent" window is added to Controller.Run,
  this window will be set to the foreground on VPM startup

Version 1.50 (November 1, 2004)
-------------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.50 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- Please see "whatsnew.txt" for PinMAME version 1.50 enhancements!
- It's now possible to run sets with missing roms as well, just as if you were running PinMAME.
  Note this will *not* work on newer Stern games which have been released in the last 3 years!

Version 1.32 (May 1, 2004)
--------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.32 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- the controller dislay will be moved to position where it is fully visible after a game was started
  (prevent not visible controller windows after a game has set the location to a position out of the desktop)
- added Controller.Hidden (bool) property to hide the controller window. The value is not persitent, hence
  will not stored in the registry and resets to 'visible' on every call to Controller.GameName (set only)

Version 1.30 (October 1, 2003)
-----------------------------
- Fixed the bug in the VPM-Setup-Program where the "Test" feature crashed under w9x
- Default synclevel is now 0 since many people are getting newer faster computers.
- Rom Aliasing: Older romset names will internally be converted to new romset names for backward compatibility

Version 1.21 (March 31, 2003)
-------------------------------------
The most prominent feature this time should be Tom's "SyncLevel"(TM),
which is a most delicate and interesting way of synchronizing two separate
Windows applications from one thread only!
In other words: Visual PinMAME decides how fast any other application
running in the same graphical environment will update its view...
need I say more?

- Added "SyncLevel" feature:
  'Controller.Games(Controller.GameName).Settings.Value("synclevel")'
  This will help to keep the Emulation in sync with any other thread
  running at the same time (like your favorite Pinball simulation software) ;)
  This should boost game performance even on lower-end PCs...
- went back to the orange display color everybody loved so much

Version 1.20 Alpha (August 24, 2002)
-------------------------------------
- switched to link zlib 1.1.4 instead of 1.1.3
- changed to use the mame .59 core and most of the mamew code (with some slight modifications)
  ("Not an ordinary change, but an ordinary bunch of work")
- added the 'Controller.ChangedLEDs' property
- added 'Game.Settings' property including the "settings"-object you receive
- added 'Controller.Settings property including the "settings"-object you receive
- by using Controller.Settings and Game.Settings access to nearly all MAME settings is available
  ('Settings.Value("name")=value'
- the emulation thread is running at a slightly higher system priority now
- the display can be resized to every size you like

Version 1.12.1 (April 14, 2002)
-------------------------------
- Nothing, the interface works fine

Version 1.12 (March 29, 2002)
-----------------------------

    for the images
- The vpinmame.dll is now compiled using the MS C++ compiler v13.0 (VS.NET)
