Using the program
-----------------

mamew [name of the game to run] [options]

for example:

   mamew mspacman -nosound

...will run Ms Pac Man without sound

Options:

* -help / -?
Displays current MAME version and copyright notice

* -list / -ls
Displays a list of currently supported games.

* -listfull / -ll
Displays a list of game directory names + descriptions.


Configuration options
---------------------

* -createconfig / -cc
Creates the default MAME.INI file. All the following configuration options
can be permanently changed by editing this configuration file.

* -showconfig / -sc
Displays the current configuration settings. If you route this to a file,
you can use it as an INI file. For example, the command:
  mamew -showconfig >mame.ini
is equivalent to -createconfig.

* -showusage / -su
Displays a summary of all the command line options. For options that are
not mentioned here, the short summary given by "mamew -showusage" is
usually sufficient.

* -[no]readconfig / -[no]rc
Enables or disables the reading of the config files. When enabled (which
is the default), MAMEW reads the following config files in order:
          - MAME.INI
          - VECTOR.INI (for vector games only)
		  - DRIVER.INI (based on the source filename of the driver)
          - PARENT.INI (for clones only)
          - GAMENAME.INI

the settings in the later files override those in the earlier files. So, for
example, if you wanted to disable hardware stretch in the vector games, you
can create a VECTOR.INI with the "hwstretch 0" line in it, and it will
override whatever hwstretch value you have in your MAME.INI.

* -[no]verbose / -[no]v (default: off)
Displays some diagnostic information at startup. IMPORTANT: when reporting
bugs, please run with mamew -verbose and include the resulting information.
It can be very helpful in tracking down problems.

Windows path and directory options
----------------------------------

* -rompath / -rp
You can give a path (list of directories seperated by semicolons) of
directories to be searched for roms. The default is ROMS (that is, a directory
"roms" in the current directory).

* -samplepath / -sp
You can give a path (list of directories seperated by semicolons) of
directories to be searched for samples. The default is SAMPLES (that is, a
directory "samples" in the current directory).

* -cfg_directory
After running a game, MAME stores some user changeable settings into
cfg_directory/gamename.cfg. Additionally, on the first start of MAME a
cfg_directory/default.cfg is created. The default is CFG.

* -nvram_directory
The original hardware of some games use non-volative ram chips to save their
configuration. The contents of these are saved into this directory. The
default is NVRAM.

* -memcard_directory
The original hardware of some games supports so-called memory cards. The
contents of these are stored here. The default is MEMCARD.

* -input_directory
Input recordings created by "-record" will be saved here and loaded by
"-playback". The default is INP.

* -hiscore_directory
If there exists a file HISCORE.DAT in the MAME directory, highscores may also
be saved for games that do not have the original hardware to support this. The
quality of this feature depends on the accuracy of the externally available
file HISCORE.DAT. The default is HI.

* -state_directory
MAME supports state saving for some games. These states will be saved here.
The default is STATE.

* -artwork_directory
Some games used extra artwork not created by electical circuits. MAME supports
such artwork in PNG image format, located in this directory. The default is
ARTWORK.

* -snapshot_directory
Screenshots will go here. The default is SNAP.

* -history_file
The default is HISTORY.DAT. Modifying the default may not work at the moment.

* -mameinfo_file
The default is MAMEINFO.DAT. Modifying the default may not work at the moment.

* -cheat_file
The default is CHEAT.DAT. Modifying the default may not work at the moment.

Disclaimer:
Please use the path, directory and file options ONLY in MAME.INI. Otherwise,
the outcome may be unpredictable and not consistent across releases.


Windows video options
---------------------

* -frameskip / -fs
Specifies the frameskip value. This is the number of frames out of every 12
to drop when running. For example, if you say -frameskip 2, then MAME will
display 10 out of every 12 frames. By skipping those frames, you may be able
to get full speed in a game that requires more horsepower than your computer
has. The default value is -frameskip 0, which skips no frames.

* -[no]autoframeskip / -[no]afs
Automatically determines the frameskip level while you're playing the game,
adjusting it constantly in a frantic attempt to keep the game running at
full speed. Turning this on overrides the value you have set for -frameskip
above. The default is ON (-autoframeskip).

* -[no]waitvsync
Waits for the refresh period on your computer's monitor to finish before
starting to draw video to your screen. If this option is off, MAMEW will
just draw to the screen at any old time, even in the middle of a refresh
cycle. This can cause "tearing" artifacts, where the top portion of the
screen is out of sync with the bottom portion. Tearing is not noticeable on
all games, and some people hate it more than others. However, if you turn
this option on, you will waste more of your CPU cycles waiting for the
proper time to draw, so you will see a performance hit. The default is OFF
(-nowaitvsync). This option requires -ddraw.

* -[no]triplebuffer / -[no]tb
Enables or disables "triple buffering". Normally, MAMEW just draws directly
to the screen, without any fancy buffering. But with this option enabled,
MAMEW creates three buffers to draw to, and cycles between them in order. It
attempts to keep things flowing such that one buffer is currently displayed,
the second buffer is waiting to be displayed, and the third buffer is being
drawn to. Unfortunately, due to some DirectDraw issues, this doesn't always
work out as well as it should. This is still being investigated. The default
is OFF (-notriplebuffer). This option required -ddraw and -nowindow.

* -[no]ddraw / -[no]dd
This is really just for testing. It disables the use of DirectDraw, which
removes a lot of the features of the video system
(-triplebuffer, -waitvsync, -resolution, -refresh, -switchres, -switchbpp, -
resolution, -hwstretch all won't work). It will generally run really slowly.
If anyone has a legitimate use for this option, I'd be curious to know. The
default is ON (-ddraw).

* -resolution wxh[xd] / -r wxh[xd]
Specifies an exact resolution to run in. In full screen mode, MAMEW will try
to use the specific resolution you request. The width (w) and height (h) are
required; the color depth (d) is optional. If omitted or set to 0, MAMEW
will determine the mode auomatically. For example, -resolution 640x480 will
force 640x480 resolution, but MAMEW is free to choose the color depth.
Similarly, -resolution 0x0x32 will force 32-bit color depth, but allows
MAMEW to choose the resolution. The string "auto" is also supported, and is
equivalent to 0x0x0. In window mode, this resolution is used as a maximum
size for the window. The default is auto (-resolution auto). This option
requires -ddraw for full screen resolution switching.

* -refresh
Specifies a particular refresh rate to set your monitor to. If the refresh
rate is not found, or if this parameter is 0, the default DirectDraw refresh
rate is used. The default is -refresh 0. This option requires -ddraw
and -nowindow.

* -[no]scanlines / -[no]sl
Enables the classic MAME "scanlines" effect. The default is OFF
(-noscanlines). This option requires -nohwstretch. It also has some bugs in
full screen mode in MAMEW 0.37b15.

* -[no]switchres
Enables resolution switching. This option is required for the -resolution
option to switch resolutions in full screen mode. On many modern video cards
with hardware stretching support, there is little performance penalty at
higher resolutions, so it is nice to be able to get rid of the monitor
resync time when you run in full screen mode. This is also useful on LCD
displays with a fixed resolution. The default is ON (-switchres). This
option requires -ddraw.

* -[no]switchbpp
Enables color depth switching. This option is required for the -resolution
option to switch color depths in full screen mode. This option is useful if
you normally run at 16, 24, or 32 bit color depth on your desktop, and want
to keep that color depth when you run MAME. The default is ON (-switchbpp).
This option requires -ddraw.

* -[no]maximize / -[no]max
Controls initial window size in windowed mode. If it is set on, the window
will initially stretch to the maximum supported size when you start MAMEW.
If it is turned off, the window will start out at the smallest supported
size. The default is ON (-maximize). This option requires -window.

* -[no]keepaspect / -[no]ka
Enables aspect ratio enforcement. When this option is on, the game's proper
aspect ratio (generally 4:3 or 3:4) is enforced, so you get the game looking
like it should. When running in a window with this option on, you can only
resize the window to the proper aspect ratio, unless you are holding down
the CONTROL key. By turning the option off, the aspect ratio is allowed to
float. In full screen mode, this means that all games will stretch to the
full screen size (even vertical games). In window mode, it means that you
can freely resize the window without any constraints. The default is ON
(-keepaspect).

* -[no]matchrefresh
Enables refresh rate matching. When enabled, MAMEW will try to find the
closest refresh rate match that is greater than the game's refresh rate. For
example, if the game runs at 57fps, and you have 60, 70, 75Hz refresh rates,
MAMEW will choose 60Hz. If the game runs at 61fps, then it will choose 70Hz.
This is intended mainly for those who have tweaked their video card's
settings to provide carefully matched refresh rate options. The default is
OFF (-nomatchrefresh). This option requires -ddraw and -nowindow.

* -[no]syncrefresh
Enables speed throttling only to the refresh of your monitor. This means
that the game's actual refresh rate is ignored; however, the sound code
still attempts to keep up with the game's original refresh rate, so you may
encounter sound problems. Again, this is intended mainly for those who have
tweaked their video card's settings to provide carefully matched refresh
rate options. The default is OFF (-nosyncrefresh). This option
requires -ddraw.

* -[no]dirty
This option is mainly for testing. It enables the use of MAME's internal
dirty pixel marking scheme, which speeds up vector games tremendously. The
default is ON (-dirty).

* -[no]throttle
Configures the default thottling setting. When throttling is on, MAMEW
attempts to keep the game running at the game's intended speed. When
throttling is off, MAMEW runs the game as fast as it can. The default is ON
(-throttle).

* -full_screen_brightness / -fsb
Some video cards adjust the brightness/gamma when they switch into full
screen mode. To counteract this, you can specify the -full_screen_brightness
value, which is a number between 0.1 and 2. 0.1 means 1/10th as bright as
the default, and 2 means twice as bright. Note that the hardware support for
this option is not present on all video cards. If you set a non-zero value,
you may get a warning if MAMEW was unable to set the brightness on your
card. The default is 0, which means that MAMEW will not attempt to adjust
the brightness on your video card at all. This option requires -ddraw
and -nowindow.

* -frames_to_run / -ftr
This option can be used for benchmarking. It tells MAMEW to stop execution
after a fixed number of frames. By combining this with a fixed set of other
command line options, you can set up a consistent environment for
benchmarking MAMEW performance.

* -effect
Apply various blitting effects to emulate the look of Arcade monitors. Using
these modes comes at the cost of reduced emulation speed, which is inherent to
these modes. The current implementation is already as fast as possible, using
self-modifying assembly code. For some of these, MMX is required. Possible
values:
  none         no effect (this is the default)
  scan25       25% scanlines
  scan50       50% scanlines
  scan75       75% scanlines
  rgb3         a certain "monitor mask"
  rgb4         another one
  rgb6         another one
  rgb16        another one. Choose the one you like best.

* -screen_aspect
Give a screen aspect ration in the form X:Y where X is the horizontal and Y
the vertical part. Examples are 4:3 for most resolution settings on computer
monitors, 5:4 for the 1280x1024 resolution or 3:4 for turnable LCD's in the
turned position. The default is 4:3.


MAME core video options
-----------------------

* -bpp
Controls the internal MAME bitmap depth. Note that this is different from
the color depth specified in the -resolution parameter. These two values do
not have to match. Internally, MAME uses 8, 16, or 32 bit bitmaps. If you
specify 0, it instructs MAME to use the preferred format. Generally, you
shouldn't need to muck with this setting at all; it is mainly for
development. The default is -bpp 0.

* -[no]norotate
* -[no]ror
* -[no]rol
* -[no]flipx
* -[no]flipy
These are the standard MAME rotation options. They are all OFF by default.

* -debug_resolution wxh / -dr wxh
Specifies the resolution of the debugger bitmap in the debug build. This
controls how big the debugger window will be, and therefore, how many
rows/columns it will display. The default value is 0x0, which sets the
automatic 640x480 default debugger size. Note that the debugger is only
available when running in a window.

* -gamma
This controls the global gamma correction in the game. It is the same gamma
that is applied when you bring up the on-screen-display within MAME. The
default is 1.0.

MAME core vector options
------------------------

* -[no]antialias / -[no]aa
Antialiasing for vector games. The default is ON (-antialias).

* -beam
Sets the width in pixels of the vectors. This option expects a float in the
range of 1.00 through 16.00 as argument. The default is 1 (1 pixel wide).

* -flicker
Makes the vectors flicker. This option requires a float argument in the
range of 0.00 - 100.00 (0=none, 100=maximum). The default is 0.

* -[no]translucency / -[no]tl
Enables or disables vector translucency. Colors of crossing vector beams
will be merged. The default is ON (-translucency).

Input device options
--------------------

* -[no]hotrod / -[no]hotrodse
Autoconfigures MAMEW for using the Hotrod/Hotrod SE. Default is OFF for both
(-nohotrod -nohotrodse).

* -[no]mouse
Controls whether or not MAMEW looks for a mouse controller to use. When this
is enabled, you will not be able to use your mouse in Windows while playing
a game. If you want to get control of your computer back, you will need to
pause the game, or quit. The default is OFF (-nomouse).

* -[no]joystick / -[no]joy
Controls whether or not MAMEW looks for joystick/gamepad controllers. When
this is enabled, MAMEW will ask DirectInput about which controllers are
connected. The default is OFF (-nojoystick).

MAME core sound options
-----------------------

* -samplerate / -sr
Sets the audio sample rate. Smaller values (e.g. 11025) cause lower audio
quality but faster emulation speed.  Higher values (e.g. 44100) cause
higher audio quality but slower emulation speed. The default is 44100.

* -[no]samples
Use samples if available. The default is ON (-samples).

* -[no]resamplefilter
If the samplerate of the original hardware does not match the samplerate
actually used by an integer factor, apply a filter. This is more faithful to
the original sound, however, the sound may not be as crisp. The default is ON
(-resamplefilter).

* -[no]sound
Enable or disable sound alltogether. The default is ON (-sound).

* -volume / -vol
Sets the startup volume. It can later be changed with the On Screen Display
(see Keys section). The volume is an attenuation in dB: e.g., "-volume -12"
will start with -12dB attenuation. The default is 0.

MAME core misc options
----------------------
* -[no]artwork / -[no]art
Enable or disable usage of additional artwork (backdrops, overlays, etc.). The
default is ON (-artwork).

* -[no]cheat / -[no]c
Cheats, like the speedup in Pac Man or the level-skip in many other games, are
disabled by default. Use this switch to turn them on. The default is OFF
(-nocheat).

* -[no]debug
Activates the integrated debugger.  During emulation, press the Tilde key
(~) to activate the debugger. This is available only if the program is
compiled with MAME_DEBUG defined. The default is OFF (-nodebug).

* -record / -rec
Expects a filename as parameter. All game inputs are written to the file
INP/filename.inp.

* -playback / -pb
Expects a filename as parameter. Play back all game inputs from from file
INP/filename.inp. The gamename is contained in this file, therefore a
gamename needs not be given on the commandline.

* -[no]log
Creates a log of illegal memory accesses in ERROR.LOG. The default is OFF
(-nolog).


Other MAME frontend options
----------------------------

Note: By default, all the '-list' commands below write info to the screen. If
you wish to write the info to a textfile instead, add this to the end of your
command:

  > filename

...where 'filename' is the textfile's path and name (e.g., c:\mame\list.txt).

 - - -

* -list / -ls
Displays a list of currently supported games.

* -listfull / -ll
Displays a list of game directory names + descriptions.

* -listroms

* -listinfo
List comprehensive details for all of the supported games.

* -listclones
Lists clones of the specified game. When no game is specified, this
generates a list of all MAME-supported clones.

* -noclones
Used together with the list commands, doesn't list alternate versions of
the same game

* -verifyroms
Checks specified game(s) for missing and invalid ROMs.  Adding * checks all
available games.

* -verifysets
Checks specified game(s) and reports its status.  Adding * checks all
available games.

* -verifysamples
Check selected game for missing samples.  Adding * checks all available
samples.
