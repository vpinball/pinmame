How to setup Visual C++ to compile PinMAME (all flavours)
=========================================================

------------------------------
Quick Setup for Advanced Users
------------------------------
- Pick your favorite Visual Studio version, and call the respective 'create_vc20XX_from_vc20XX.bat' to create the sln and vcproj files
- For 32bit: - In Visual Studio set an additional include path to the DX7a-SDK include folder, and an additional library path to the DX7a-SDK lib\x86 folder
             - Also set an additional executable path to a NASM folder
- For 64bit: - In Visual Studio set an additional library path to the DX(June 2010)-SDK lib\x64 folder



ToDo:
* Re-check first and last supported versions of WSDK, MSDN, etc. for all VS versions

-------
General
-------
To use a Visual C++ version for compiling the following is necessary:
- Latest service pack for Visual Studio or Visual C++
- Compatible Windows Platform SDK
- Compatible DirectX SDK (with DirectInput 7)
- Optionally a compatible MSDN Library
  or a free MSDN Lib
  MSDN Library für Visual Studio 2008 SP1 (April 2009)
  http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=7bbe5eda-5062-4ebb-83c7-d3c5ff92a373
- Checksum Integrity Verification
  https://support.microsoft.com/kb/841290 

Additionally the following is necessary:
- NASM compiler for the assembler parts
  a) Download the assembler compiler NASM 2.0 for Win32 to a download directory.
     Binary package:
     * nasm-2.02-win32 (later versions should work too)
     Get it from http://www.nasm.us/pub/nasm/releasebuilds/
  b) Extract NASM into a separate directory, for example c:\nasm
     Note: If an older NASM Win32 package is used (<0.99.4), then rename the
           executables to "nasm.exe" and "ndisasm.exe" by removing the W letter.
  c) Add this directory to the bin directories of Visual C++.

Update 2015-08: Microsoft has removed support for VS/VC 6.0 completely, all download and documentation links are now disfunctional

Additional notes on Express Editions:
- Both (2005 & 2008) work fine without any changes and can compile PinMAME and PinMAME32
  http://www.microsoft.com/express/
  VS 2008 SP1 Express: http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/en/details.aspx?FamilyID=3254c868-bcb9-412c-95c6-d100c872ec60
- The Express Editions are lacking the resource editors and also support for ATL
  and MFC projects. VPinMAME is an ATL DLL project (Release = MinDependency) and
  therefore not compilable with a normal Express Edition setup.
  http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hs24szh9.aspx
- Through investigations we found out that it is possible to compile VPinMAME
  with the Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition by using a "trick":
  Install the 90-day Trial Version of Visual C++ 2008 *and* the Express Edition.
  With the trial version you get all the ATL and MFC includes plus libraries.
  The Express Edition still contains all the configuration settings to use these.
  This way you can compile existing ATL and MFC projects, but you can not create
  a new ATL or MFC project as the corresponding wizard definitions are missing
  in the Express Edition.
  Btw this "trick" failed with the Express Edition of VisualC++ 2005.

  - Difference between MSDN release and trial ISOs is only the product key in "Setup\setup.sdb", and sometimes depending on the language the DVD name.
    So the trial ISO has the full retail content and can be unlimited with a key.

Compilation
-----------
- Directly load a project file (*.dsp/.sln or .vcproj), choose between Release or
  Debug build and then compile.


----------------
Virtual Machines (or placing intermediate files somewhere else)
----------------
The project files for VC++ 2002 (and later) allow to place the intermediate
files into a separate location. This can be very useful if you get the error
"fatal error C1090: PDB API call failed, error code '23'", which can happen
quite a lot in virtual machines with shared folders.

To use a different location just set the environment variable VS_OUTPUT to the
desired location plus a backslash. A trailing backslash is MANDATORY if you use it!!!
If you set or changed the environment variable while Visual Studio was running,
then you have to exit and restart Visual Studio for the change to take effect.

If the environment variable VS_OUTPUT is not set or empty, then the OBJ folder
will be inside the project folder as usual.


-------------------
Addendum: Libraries
-------------------
<Outdated>

- The ZLib library for Visual C++ 6.0 is already included in the CVS repository.
  If you want to compile it yourself then get the following package:
  a) ZLib source code
     * zlib-1.1.4.tar.gz
     Get it from http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpng/files/zlib/1.1.4/
     Note: Newer versions of ZLib work too (currently 1.2.3).
  b) If you want to test the assembler optimised version you also need MASM from
     Microsoft. You can use it for free, but not for commercial use.
     Get the Processor Pack for Visual C++ 6.0:
     * (non-functional) http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/aa718349.aspx
     * (non-functional) http://www.infinitefactors.org/jonk/pctools.html
     Extract it to a temporary directory, for example c:\masm, copy the
     following files into a separate directory and add it to the bin directories
     of Visual C++:
     * H2INC.ERR
     * H2INC.EXE
     * ML.ERR
     * ML.EXE
     * MASMREF.DOC
	 Versions:
	 * 6.14 from Win 98 DDK
	 * 6.15 from Processor Pack for Visual C++ 6.0
	 * There's also a 8.0 from Microsoft Downloads
