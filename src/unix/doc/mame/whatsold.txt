Sorry, this list of changes isn't complete due to hardware problems I'm having.

General Source Changes
----------------------

Many Improvements to the ST-V emulation, resulting in Hanagumi Columns being
playable and other games on the driver starting to show some
graphics [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
	src/drivers/stv.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp1.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c

Continued MegaPlay Improvements (still none fulyl working yet but more of the
bios menu tests pass now) [Barry Rodewald]
	src/drivers/segac2.c

Some System GX Improvements, mainly to the not yet working games [R.Belmont]
	src/drivers/konamigx.c
	src/vidhrdw/konamigx.c

Attempted to Improve Super Dodge Ball MCU Simulation [Acho A. Tang]
	src/drivers/sdodgeb.c
	src/vidhrdw/sdodgeb.c

Various Changes to keep the code inline with MESS [Nathan Woods]

Added 8 Player Support to the Core [Stefan Jokisch]

New games supported:
--------------------

Hanagumi Taisen Columns - Sakura Wars  [Angelo Salese, David Haywood]
	This the first st-v game to be supported by MAME, please note that due
	to the complexity of the system emulation is still preliminary and there
	are still various issues that will need ironing out, there is currently
	no sound.
	src/drivers/stv.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp1.c
	src/vidhrdw/stvvdp2.c

Ultra X Weapons [Tomasz Slanina]
	some gfx offset problems / alignment (sprite handle can move?)
	src/drivers/ssv.c

Twin Eagle 2 [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/ssv.c
	Twin Eagle 2 DOES NOT WORK due to protection involving the directions
	in which objects travel, and as a side-effect collisions don't work
	correctly either, if somebody fixes this then itmight be fine apart
	from a few offset problems.

Super Trivia Master [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]
	wrong colours
	src/drivers/strvmstr.c

Sprint 8 [Stefan Jokisch]
	src/drivers/sprint8.c
	src/vidhrdw/sprint8.c

New Clones supported:
--------------------

Lady Bug (bootleg on Galaxian Hardware) [Mike Coates]
	input ports incomplete
	src/drivers/galaxian.c
	src/includes/galaxian.h
	src/machine/scramble.c

Video Pool (Moon Cresta hardware) (bootleg of Video Hustler) [Mike Coates]
	dipswitches incomplete
	src/drivers/galaxian.c

0.72u2

General Source Changes
----------------------

Improved Megaplay a bit, the bios screens now show however the games still don't
work [Barry Rodewald]
	src/drivers/segac2.c
	src/includes/segac2.h
	src/vidhrdw/segac2.c

Various ST-V improvements, Hanagumi Columns shows a partial title screen (still
disabled so you'll have to enable it yourself if you want to see)
	[Angelo Salese]
	src/drivers/stv.c

Removed DCS Speed-Ups
	src/sndhrdw/dcs.c

Fixed a bug in the C 68000 core with the SBCD Opcode [Acho A/ Tang]
	States of the sign(N) and overflow(V) flags after SBCD,
	ABCD and NBCD operations are "undefined" according to Motorola.
	The C core randomizes the V flag and sets the N flag like signed
	operations.

	Viofight expects determinant results of the two flags from SBCD
	or it gets stuck in a math loop. The V flag now returns zero and
	the N flag mirrors carry exactly like what the ASM core does.
	src/cpu/m68000/m68k_in.c

Fixed Mustache Boy Continue Screen and attempted to improve speed [Tomasz Slanina]
	src/drivers/mustache.c

Misc Konami Fixes [Acho A. Tang]
	tmnt.c:
	- qgakumon resetting and screen darkening
	- tmnt2 load-save states(not good enough yet)
	- ssriders diagonal jittering(needs testing)

	konamiic.c:
	- boundary conditions and kludge removal in K007420

	rockrage.c:
	- rogue sprites

	kncljoe.c:
	- bad scrolling, clipping, rogue sprites

Couple of Improvements to the Fuuki games (Priority, BG Colours) [Paul Priest]
	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c
	src/drivers/fuukifg3.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg3.c

Guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM overflows [Nathan Woods]
	This patch adds an optional facility to guard against OP_ROM/OP_RAM
	overflows.  This is implemented by adding new variables OP_MEM_MIN and
	OP_MEM_MAX that track the minimum and maximum address ranges for which
	using OP_ROM/OP_RAM is valid.

	Support for this feature is enabled via conditional compilation in
	memory.h.  There are three possible modes:

	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE   - The status quo; no range checking at
	all
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_PARTIAL  - Range checking only against the
	maximum address
	CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL     - Range checking against both the
	minimum and the maximum

	This patch has MAME using CPUREADOP_SAFETY_NONE, unless MAME_DEBUG is
	defined in which case CPUREADOP_SAFETY_FULL is set.  Thus as is, this
	patch should have zero effect on release versions of MAME.
	Additionally, being able to safely disassemble code near bank boundaries
	when using the MAME debugger is extremely useful.

	There is a slight performance hit when this is enabled.

Dipswitch Fixes:
	1st dipswitch of 3rd bank in 1941 [Fabrizio Pedrazzini]
	src/drivers/cps1.c

	Tetris Plus 2 (MS32 version) [Sonikos]
	src/drivers/ms32.c

	and a few others ...

Changed nkdodgeb to use proms from another Japan bootleg set, maybe this fixes
some problems with the colours.
	src/drivers/nkdodgeb.c

Included 8080 core updates from MESS
	src/cpu/i8085/*

Preliminary Hyperstone Core, not yet working well enough to run anything [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

Now using correct Dragon Blaze sound ROM
	src/drivers/psikyosh.c

New Clones supported:

Hard Dunk (World)
	src/drivers/multi32.c

Super Bike (DK Conversion) [Pierpaolo Prazzoli]

General Source Changes
----------------------

Changed Fuuki 16-bit driver to use Partial Updates for Raster Effects and enabled
them [David Haywood, Paul Priest]
	src/drivers/fuukifg2.c
	src/vidhrdw/fuukifg2.c

Temporary Fixes to a few of the System 16 driver problems (sound banking for
example)  Note, the driver is still being rewritten these are only minor 'fixes'
to improve things a bit until the rewrite is complete [Acho A. Tang]
	src/drivers/sysetm16.c
	src/vidhrdw/system16.c
	src/vidhrdw/sys16spr.c

Change so DIP menu isn't displayed if no Dipswitches are defined in the driver
instead of flashing a blank mneu when you try and enter it [Paul Priest]
	src/usrintrf.c

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/cpu/jaguar/jaguar.c:
	- Fixed a bug in the NORMI opcode

	src/cpu/mips/mips.c:
	- Removed use of the GCC specific varargs on macros feature

	src/sndhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/sound/tms5220.c:
	src/sound/tms5220.h:
	- Added support for the TMS0285 variant (an old variant of the
	TMS5220)

	src/vidhrdw/jagblit.c:
	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Added support for the SRCSHADE and DSTA2 command bits to the
	Jaguar blitter.
	- Added some miscellaneous logging code
	- Changed around one of the #include paths (due to
	ProjectBuilder on Mac issues)

	src/vidhrdw/jagobj.c:
	- Added support for objects with pitch != 1 for objects with 1-2
	bits per pixels

	src/harddisk.c:
	src/harddisk.h:
	- Added a function to retrieve the interface

	src/ui_text.c:
	src/ui_text.h:
	- Added a MESS specific UI string (within #ifdef MESS of course)

	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Parameterized the setdipswitches() call; so that a menu that
	looks like the DIP switch menu can easily be made with different IPT_*
	values (MESS has a configuration menu that functions a lot like the DIP
	switch menu)

	src/artwork.c:
	- Small fix to allow the UI to be drawn if the artwork system is
	active but no artwork is present (not an issue for MAME)

	src/mamedbg.c:
	- Cleanup and fix of set_ea_info() so that negative offsets of 8
	or 16 bits do not have extraneous FF's in front of them.
	- More proper fix to the scanline display bug that prevented
	registers from being edited when the scanline display was on.

	src/cpu/hd6309/6309dasm.c:
	- Better message for when invalid opcodes are disassembled

	src/artwork.c
	src/artwork.h
	- Fixed crashing bug with clones

	src/inptport.c:
	- Adds some MESS specific IPT defaults (within #ifdef MESS)
	- Modified input_port_allocate() so that PORT_BITX declarations
	that specify JOYCODE_a_BUTTONb for their default codes will also get
	JOYCODE_MOUSE_a_BUTTONb or'd in.

	src/input.c:
	src/input.h:
	- Added seq_set_4() and seq_set_5()

	src/windows/video.c:
	- Changed render_frame() so that throttle_speed() will also be
	called when game_is_paused is set.  This prevents MAME from busy looping
	when paused.

Fixed Remaining Protection problems in TMNT2 and Sunset Riders, Fixed Combat School
Trackball sets from Crashing, Fixed Escape Kids Spries, Fixed Sticky Sprites in
Detana! Twinbee, Fixed Sprite Lag in some games [Acho A. Tang]

FAQ about new drivers added since 0.71
--------------------------------------

for Run and Gun you must hold down F2 and press F3 to init the Eeprom otherwise
the game won't boot, the rungunu set doesn't work correctly.

Megatech / Megaplay / NSS are preliminary, since the menu system doesn't yet work
perfectly on Megatech I've marked all the games as non-working, Megaplay still
doesn't boot so those are marked as Non-working, and the NSS menu isn't emulated
at all yet so I also consider that to be Non-working, I've enabled these anyway
as it may encourage others to help with the development, Mame is NOT turning into
an emulator for Consoles, these are Arcade systems much like PlayChoice-10.

Outrunners is currently still broken due to problems with the V60 and recent timer
updates, sorry.

The games using the sp0250 sound for speech still need samples for the sound
effects, however samples for the speech are no longer needed with this update.

Vector Cleanups / Improvements [Frank Palazzolo]
	- Removed VEC_SHIFT and "magic numbers" stuff from all drivers, 
	vector.c: all fixed point stuff is now always 16.16.
	- Removed "bad trench vectors hack" from Star Wars which I created in 
	1997.  Appears not to be necessary any more :)
	- Moved flipping and swapping API stuff from vector.c to avgdvg.c, 
	this is specific to tempest and quantum only.
	- Added clipping to Sega games per the schematics
	- Using floating point in vector.c to do scaling.
	- Removed dead code using Machine->orientation from vector.c
	- Added capability to register an external vector renderer.

Various Changes [Nathan Woods]
	src/fileio.c:
	- Introduced a "debug cookie"; when in debug mode, puts a cookie
	value in the mame_file structure to prevent files from being closed
	twice without an assertion

	src/windows/window.c:
	- Fixes a bug in visible area changing in windowed, non-stretch
	mode.  Previously, when the visible area changed, the code would simply
	change the visible area, and look at the resulting window size and tweak
	it accordingly with win_adjust_window().  The problem with this is that
	if you have a sequence where the visible area is made larger, then
	smaller again, what would happen is you wouldn't get the original window
	size; you would simply get the enlarged window with a bunch of buffer
	area.  Now instead of calling win_adjust_window(), I added code that
	preserves the "scale" factors, and the space between the emulation
	rectangle and the window client area.

	src/windows/winddraw.h:
	src/windows/winddraw.c:
	src/windows/wind3d.c:
	- Added a call win_ddraw_fullscreen_margins() that given the
	dwWidth and dwHeight parameters of a DirectDraw surface, comes up with a
	RECT that represents the margins.  For MAME, this is a very simple
	operation (a rectangle from (0,0)-(dwWidth,dwHeight)) (and the
	implementation that I've submitted is corrspondingly simple), but in
	MESS the window can have a menu bar so this operation works differently.
	I've also modified winddraw.c and wind3d.c to use this call.

	src/timer.c:
	src/timer.h:
	- Changes timers so that they are now 'mame_timer *' instead of
	'void *'.  mame_timer is an opaque structure, similar to mame_file in
	fileio.h.  I didn't update any code using timers yet; it doesn't seem to
	me that there isn't a rush and since they used 'void *' before,
	everything compiles just fine.  I hope noone objects to this one.

	src/vidhrdw/jaguar.c:
	- Fixes a potential crash in jaguar_tom_regs_w() (while this
	crash doesn't occur under normal execution of the cojag games though, it
	can occur if modified ROMs are being used).

	src/sound/fmopl.c:
	Added #if/#endif pair

Changed message for Double Clicking on EXE slightly [Leon van Rooij]

Various Sound Improvements to YM2610, YM2608, Y8950 [Jarek Burczynski]
	Inspired by Frits Hilderink (NLMSX emulator author) I attempted to:
	- improve support of the ymdeltat module for the status registers (YM2610,YM2608,Y8950),
	- implement x1bit/x8bit DRAM usage for the ADPCM samples,
	- implement memory read/write via deltat (Y8950 and YM2608)
	- ADPCM synthesis in 'slave' mode (CPU controlled, instead of memory based).

	I made some tests but the changes are quite big so please test them before including. I'm sure the
	Y8950 will be tested by NLMSX authors too.

	- Renames display_fps() to ui_display_fps() and makes it
	non-static
	
	src/windows/fileio.c:
	- In osd_fopen(), if a file is opened with mode "r",
	FILE_SHARE_READ will be passed to the dwShareMode parameter of
	CreateFile().  This allows other programs to read any files that MAME
	opens for read only.

	src/mamedbg.c

Changed a few MAME core files for MESS (shouldn't change Mame behavior) [Nathan Woods]
	src/usrintrf.h:
	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Adds four new calls to control showing the fps count and the
	profiler:
	void ui_show_fps_set(int show);
	int ui_show_fps_get(void);
	void ui_show_profiler_set(int show);
	int ui_show_profiler_get(void);

	src/machine/idectrl.c:
	src/machine/idectrl.h:
	src/harddisk.c:
	src/harddisk.h:
	src/hdcomp.c:
	- Enhances the hard disk code to support sector sizes other than
	512 bytes (a non-IDE harddisk in MESS for one of the TI systems uses
	this).  src/machine/idectrl.c has been modified to take this into
	account; it requires that HD images be 512 bytes.  The new code is fully
	backwards compatible with old CHDs that do not have a sector size within
	them.

This contains all the updates listed which were part of the source only diffs listed below
(0.69a, 0.69b, 0.69u3) plus a few extra bits and pieces.  A couple of drivers still appear to
be broken with the new timer system (deadang, artmagic for example) but hopefully most of the
problems were ironed out.

0.69u3 (0.69 Update 3)

source diff, changed numbering system to ux instead of a,b,c because people were getting
confused and thinking mame069b.zip (mame 0.69 _b_inary) was the updated version when it
wasn't.

misc fixes and improvements this time, no changes related to the timer system so as far
as testing that goes this isn't an essential upgrade.

if you use this code in your own build of Mame please make sure you use the correct
version number to reflect the inclusion of this updated code.

A number of Changes to the Timer System [Aaron Giles]

	All the CPU scheduling has moved into cpuexec.c and been taken out of
	timer.c. A number of bugs relating to time tracking for suspended CPUs have
	been fixed.

	A side effect of all this is a change in the behavior of the CPU scheduling.
	For the most part, games are fine with this. However, there were a few
	exceptions:

	* taitosj.c: timing of the MCU communication broke
	* arkanoid.c: timing of the MCU communication broke
	* harddriv.c: stunrun timing glitches, racedriv/steeltal/hdrivair broken
	
	(There may be more, but I haven't found them yet.)

	The first two problems have been fixed, as has racedriv, but steeltal,
	hdrivair, and stunrun still have issues.
	
	Oh, one other useful function I added is this:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(double timeslice_duration, double boost_duration);

	You call this if you need to temporarily crank up the interleave for a short
	period of time in order to get CPU synchronization working. I used this in
	arkanoid and taitosj to get the MCU communications working. For example, you
	could say:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(TIME_IN_USEC(1), TIME_IN_USEC(100));

	which would interleave the CPUs on 1 usec boundaries for the next 100 usecs.
	Even more useful is this:

	   cpu_boost_interleave(0, TIME_IN_USEC(10));

	A very small value (0) for the first parameter means "use perfect
	synchronization", which should guarantee cycle-accurate synchronization for
	the specified duration. Note that this is *really* slow, so you don't want
	to be doing it too much!

	Let us know ASAP if anything else is broken as a result of this update

0.69

Mainly a bugfix release for problems discovered with new features in 0.68,
it also further clears the backlog.  Put together by David Haywood, 

If you submit changes please make sure they're up to date with the latest
source code, if not it means more work for us in sorting them out.

Several people have asked about the SHA1Merger program for updating their
own drivers, if you need this it should be on www.mame.net within a few
hours of this release.

Note, we are aware of some problems with the Direct 3D core which cause
some games to function incorrectly (Rolling Thunder title screen, Hard
Drivin' Dashboard, Puyo Puyo title screen raster etc.) if you have problems
with games when using -d3d try them without before reporting a bug. (although
please do report games broken with -d3d if you find them but make sure to
specify the problem is with -d3d)

The cause of this problem seems to lie somewhere in

result = IDirect3D7_CreateDevice(d3d7, &IID_IDirect3DHALDevice, back_surface, &d3d_device7);

however we don't know how to fix this nor why it happens, could the real problem
be elsewhere?

	src\cpu\pic16c5x\pic16c5x.c

Fixed a few MCU simulation problems in bking3 [Angelo Salese]
	src\drivers\bking2.c

Various changes [Nathan Woods]

	src/cheat.c:
	- Minor change to the MESS specific code

	src/datafile.c:
	- DriverDataCompareFunc() is now declared with CLIB_DECL

	src/hash.c:
	- Removed strupr() in favor a manual implementation, because it
	is non-ANSI

	src/usrintrf.c:
	- Minor tweaks within #ifdef MESS code
	- UI code for discrete sound engine now encapsulated within '#if
	HAS_DISCRETE'

	src/ui_text.c:
	src/ui_text.h:
	- Changed some #ifdef MESS specific strings

	src/windows/rc.c:
	src/windows/rc.h:
	- Fixed a potential crash that could occur if the last line in
	an INI file was not terminated with a CRLF
	- Added osd_rc_write(); which does the reverse as osd_rc_read()
	(this is only used in the MESS Win32 port)

	src/fileio.c:
	src/fileio.h:
	- New mame_fputs(), mame_vfprintf() and mame_fprintf() functions
	(used in osd_rc_write()) above
	
	src/windows/fileio.c:
	- Removed some no longer relevant MESS globals
	- Unicode enabled (i.e. - compiles under #define UNICODE)

	src/windows/winalloc.c:
	- Added corresponding _msize implementation (this fixes a benign
	but very subtle bug when debugging with VC)

	src/idectrl.c:
	src/idectrl.h:
	- Added ide_controller_init_custom() (used by MESS)

	src/fileio.c:
	src/hash.c:

	(apparently these are already defined on the Mac)

	src/windows/winalloc.c:
	src/windows/winmain.c:
	- Put CLIB_DECL in front of a few declarations


Various Changes [Andrea Mazzoleni]

	src/info.c
	- Substitutes in the -listinfo output the strings "nodump" and "baddump"
	  with "flags nodump" and "flags baddump".

	src/sound/disc_mth.c
	- Substitutes the _HUGE macro with the standard DBL_MAX value
	
	src/cpu/tms9900/9900stat.h
	src/cpu/tms9900/99xxstat.h
	- Adds a test for the GNU C compiler to skip some POWERPC inline assembler
	  not compatible with the GNU assembler format.

	src/x86drc.h
	- Fixes some macros with arguments not used. Otherwise it doesn't compile
	  with gcc 2.95.3.

Auditing Fixes for cases where no good dump is known but a file is found [BUT]
	src\audit.c
	
Improvements and Bug Fixes to the Direct 3D Blitting [Leon van Rooij]

	-effect same as 0.68 and earlier, no effect on d3d module
	-zoom or -z (default is 2) select zoom level, works for the ddraw code as well
	find the smallest display mode that will fit an n times zoomed game image
	(only used when no display mode is explicitly forced,
	the d3d code takes the aspect ratio into account, ddraw behaviour is 
	unchanged)
	-cleanstretch or -cs only strecth to integer ratios, works for the ddraw 
	code as well

	-d3dfilter or -d3dflt select filtering algorithm
	0 is none, 1 bi-linear, 2 flat bi-cubic, 3 gaussian bicubic, 4 anisotropic
	-d3deffect behaves exactly the same as -effect, but only affects the d3d module
	You can use all -effect parameters, so none, scan25, scan50, scan75,
	rgb16, rgb6, rgb4, rgb3, and sharp work, they are identical at 2x zoom
	scan75v and rgb4v also work, and are identical to scan75 adn rgb4
	(as the d3d effects are automatically rotated already)
	Additionally, all effects presets and auto work
	none affects only the presets now.
	The presets are renamed, in addition to the -effect presets, they are now:
	rgbminmask,
	dotmedmask,
	rgbmedmask,
	rgbmicro
	rgbtiny
	aperturegrille,
	dotmedbright,
	rgbmaxbright

	-d3dscan scanline intensity, 100 is off
	-d3dfeedback feedback intensity, 0 is off
	-d3dsaturate oversaturation intensity, 0 is off
	-d3dprescale AKA sharp.
	-d3dcustom custom preset, as before
	(anyone who wants to customise presets can, everybody else should ignore it)
	-d3dexpert Normal users should not use this one, basically if you can't 
	read the
	source to figure out what it does, you have no business using it <g>
	Behaves as -effect did in the previous updates, plus some new stuff;
	disable disables all effects,
	prescale lets you control prescale explicitly,
	pixelcounter changes the scanline texture
	(use mame whatever -z 4 -d3d -cs -flt 0 -d3dexpert pixelcounter),
	norotate disables rotating effects
	
	It has it's own ini section and it handles priorities itself to ensure 
	correct behaviour. For custom presets, patterns are no longer loaded from 
	the effects directory, the name should just include the path.
	
	There are warning messages when you do e.g. -nod3d -d3dscan50, or -d3d 
	-effect sharp (although the latter will work as it has up until 0.68). It 
	tests all hardware capabilities it should (as far as I'm aware, at least). 
	It won't chop textures in 256x256 blocks for old Voodoo cards. 
	-texture_management is now enabled by default as leaving it off seems to 
	have worse consequences for more people than having it on. I haven't added 
	a workaround for cards that can't render to textures yet, other than that, 
	any possible typos, etc. or any suggestions people may have, it should be 
	good for 0.69.
	
	Apparently some videocards don't like the DX7 pageflip in combination with 
	a triple buffer. (behaviour when triple buffering is unchanged from 0.67, 
	that goes for the d3d code as well as the ddraw code).

Added -bios option [Paul Priest]

Adds the system option "bios". An integer that is valid where: 0 <= n < 15

	Rom loading is now modified so that if any of the 4 bits in
	ROM_BIOSFLAGSMASK of the rom flags are set, it will only be loaded if
	the value+1 == options.bios

	NeoGeo has been modified to take advantage of this as follows:
	0 - "sp-s2.sp1"    - Europe, 1 Slot (also been seen on a 4 slot) (default)
	1 - "sp-s.sp1"     - Europe, 4 Slot
	2 - "usa_2slt.bin" - US, 2 Slot
	3 - "sp-e.sp1"     - US, 6 Slot (V5?)
	4 - "asia-s3.sp1"  - Asia S3 Ver 6

Fixed FM bug causing bad sounds in maglord and other games which was introduced in
the last release [Jarek Burczynski]

Discrete Sound update for several games [Derrick Renaud]

	- Atari Baseball - added video invert (triples/home runs).
	- Avalanche - changed to discrete sounds adding missing top rocks sound
	(Aud0 trigger). (and yes the game is supposed to sound horrible)
	- Dominos - added 60Hz ac signal (but it does not seem to affect anything).
	- Drag Race - added discrete sounds.
	- Night Driver - added discrete sounds and video invert during crash.
	Motor/skid sounds are not 100% correct.
	- Sprint 2 - switched player controls so they lined up under the proper
	score color.
	- Orbit - added discrete sounds.

	- [but] fixed the 'no stereo' bug in src\sound\discrete.c
	- I also fixed a minor bug in src\sound\discrete.h causing
	DISCRETE_LOGIC_INVERT not to work.
	- And did minor code cleanup to Basketball.
	- Removed GAME_IMPERFECT_SOUND flag from Circus.  If correct samples are
	used then it is ok, like all sample games.  (New accurate samples have been
	posted at twisty's)

Mame Blitter Generation Code [Phil Stroffolino]
	src\mameblit.c
	src\mame.c
	src\mame.h
	src\drawgfx.c
	src\blitgen.c

Basic Direct3D blitting support [Leon van Rooij]

You need DirectX7 headers and libs to compile it, I'm using the set from
http:\\caesar.logiqx.com\html\tools\compilers\mingw.shtml which has the
original MS headers (the same set is used for Allegro and FB Alpha) and
I've made a minor update to the ddraw code so that it compiles with this
set of headers (VC++ should still be fine as well).

The code manually imports the DirectDrawCreateEx() function so MAME
compiled with d3d support will (or rather should, I've not actually tested
that yet) still run on PC's with older versions of DirectX. It should work
with pretty much any 3D hardware (except perhaps older Voodoo-based cards),
and the speed should be similar to the DirectDraw blit (a bit faster for
some older cards).

-direct3d or -d3d: use Direct3D (default is off, overrides -dd);
-filter or -flt: use bi-linear filtering (default is on);
-texture_management: use DirectX texture management (default is off, but
 some 3D cards need this (however, there's a small-ish speed-penalty)).

An interim release with many things submitted in the past two months not
included yet.


These drivers have improved GRAPHICS:
-------------------------------------

- Subroc-3D, Turbo and Buck Rogers use the artwork to show the LED counters.
  [Stefan Jokish]

- Fixed colors in Dynamic Ski. [Stefan Jokish]


These drivers have improved SOUND:
----------------------------------

- Samples support in Subroc-3D [Dave France]

- Fixed noie frequency in the Exidy games. [Jim Hernandez]

- Preliminary Namco NA sound support. [Phil Stroffolino]


Other drivers changes:
----------------------

- Partially simulated the protection in Birdie Try [Angelo Salese]

- Improved decryption in Quiz F1 1-2 Finish, it's still incomplete though.
  [Angelo Salese]

- Fixed ball position recognition in Golfing Greats. [Olivier Galibert]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- New options -nodisclaimer and -nogameinfo to disable startup screens.
  Warnings about incorrect emulation are not disabled. [Aaron Giles]

- Replaced RDTSC timing with QueryPerformanceCounter. This should fix problems
  on SpeedStep notebooks. It seems, however, that it causes even worse problems
  on other machines. Therefore, the old behaviour can be forced with the new
  -rdtsc option. [smf]


Source:
-------

- Now compiled with MinGW 2.0/GCC 3.2. There might be bugs caused by the new
  compiler, let us know.

- All new, much better, YM2413 emulation. [Jarek Burczynski]

- Drum support in YM2608 emulation (check e.g. Tail 2 Nose). [Jarek Burczynski]

- Moved most of the file I/O out of the OS depndant code and into the core.
  Added two new types, mame_file and osd_file, which enforce better type
  checking throughout the system (and prevents confusing the two).
  Instead of calling osd_fopen, osd_fread, osd_fwrite, etc., you now call
  mame_fopen, mame_fread, mame_fwrite, etc. The osd_* calls are reserved
  to the core.
  All the ZIP handling is done in the mame_file functions, so it will be
  inherited by all ports.
  [Aaron Giles]

- [Win32] The diff, snap, cfg, nvram, etc. directories are created
  automatically if they don't exist the first time MAME tries to create a file
  there. [Aaron Giles]

- MIPS III/IV CPU cores. [Aaron Giles]

- ADSP-2115 CPU support. [Aaron Giles]

- TMS32025 CPU core. [Quench]

- Fixed YMF278B emulation. [R.Belmont]

- Fixed tilemaps in Sotsugyo Shousho. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Fixed graphics in Pinbo. [Zsolt Vasvari]

- Improved raster effects handling in NeoGeo games. [Razoola]

- Improved gfx in HAL21. [Acho A. Tang]

- Preliminary support for raster effects in CPS2 games. [Barry Rodewald]

- Added alpha blending to Psikyo games. [Paul Priest]

- Fixed Y8950 confincting with YM3812/YM3526 in some SNK games.
  [Jarek Burczynski]

- Fixed sound in Spinal Breakers. [Nicola Salmoria]

- Sound in HAL21. [Acho A. Tang]


Other drivers changes:

- Fixed controls & gfx in Outrun and Space Harrier. [Bryan McPhail]

- Simulated protection in S.P.Y. [Acho A. Tang]

- Fixed Rip Cord. [Acho A. Tang]

- Fixed collision detection in Labyrinth Runner and Fast Lane. [Acho A. Tang]

- Fixed protection in Funky Jet [Bryan mcPhail, Stephane Humbert]

- Several fixes to the F3 games. [Shiriru, Bryan McPhail]


Changes to the main program:
----------------------------

- Light gun support. [Bryan McPhail]


Source:
-------

- Important for porters: major redesign of the OS interface for display update.
  - VIDEO_SUPPORTS_DIRTY flag removed
  - osd_mark_dirty() removed
  - osd_create_display() now takes an extra parameter rgb_components
  - osd_set_visible_area() removed
  - osd_allocate_colors() removed
  - osd_modify_pen() removed
  - osd_update_video_and_audio() now takes a mame_display pointer
  - osd_debugger_focus() removed
  - osd_set/get_gamma() removed
  - osd_set/get_brightness() removed
  [Aaron Giles]

- Completely redesigned the artwork handling. Any game can now use artwork,
  with no specific support in the driver. Configuration is done with external
  .art files. [Aaron Giles]
  -[no]artcrop -- crops artwork to the game screen area only
  -[no]backdrop -- enables/disables backdrop art
  -[no]overlay -- enables/disables overlay art
  -[no]bezel -- enables/disables bezel art

- The Windows version now rotates the screen at blit time instead of requiring
  the core to do so. Since the new code is usually faster than the old one, and
  it allows for great simplifications in the core, rotation at blit time will
  probably be a requirement in next release. Porters are advised to begin
  implementing it now. [Aaron Giles]

- New YM-2413 emulator. [Fabio R. Schmidlin, Charles Mac Donald]

- New macros have been added to declare common callback functions and enforce
  naming conventions. All drivers have been converted to the new macros:

      void init_drivername()            -> DRIVER_INIT( name )
      int generate_int()                -> INTERRUPT_GEN( func )
      void name_init_machine()          -> MACHINE_INIT( name )
      void nvram_handler()              -> NVRAM_HANDLER( name )
      void name_vh_convert_color_prom() -> PALETTE_INIT( name )
      int name_vh_start()               -> VIDEO_START( name )
      void name_vh_stop()               -> VIDEO_STOP( name )
      void name_vh_eof()                -> VIDEO_EOF( name )
      void name_vh_screenrefresh()      -> VIDEO_UPDATE( name )

- Major change to the way machine drivers are set up. A series of macros is
  now available (defined in driver.h) to "build up" a machine driver. The
  ordering of items in the machine driver is arbitrary, apart from CPU-specific
  data, which is tied to the most-recently referenced CPU. With this new format,
  machine drivers can now be built by modifying another machine driver,
  providing a primitive inheritance mechanism. See any driver for an example
  of the new format. See mcr.c for a more complex example of inheritance.

- New functions auto_bitmap_alloc() and auto_bitmap_alloc_depth() are now
  available to create automatically managed bitmaps. Combined with auto_malloc(),
  there is no need for a video_stop function in most cases. All existing
  drivers have been modified to take advantage of these features.

- The old interrupt system has now been made officially obsolete. This means
  that the function cpu_cause_interrupt() is no longer available; you must use
  cpu_set_irq_line() or cpu_set_irq_line_and_vector() instead. It also means
  that a number of old/conflicting constants have been removed. In addition,
  interrupt generation callbacks for CPUs no longer return an IRQ line or
  vector. Instead, the interrupt callback must actively cause the interrupt
  via cpu_set_irq_line(). All existing drivers have been updated to these
  changes.

- New interrupt callback functions: nmi_line_pulse(), nmi_line_assert(),
  irqn_line_hold(), irqn_line_pulse(), irqn_line_assert(). These functions
  replace the old interrupt() and nmi_interrupt() callbacks and can be used
  directly as interrupt callbacks.

- The function tilemap_set_clip() has been removed. In its place, there is a
  new 'cliprect' parameter to tilemap_draw(). All existing drivers have been
  updated to support this change.

- In preparation for partial updating support, the parameters to video_update
  have changed. A new parameter 'cliprect' has been added, which should be
  honored. In the future, the parameter will contain the subset of the screen
  to render; for now, it just contains Machine->visible_area. In addition,
  the 'full_refresh' parameter is gone; update functions must always redraw
  the requested portion of the bitmap. Some drivers have been updated to fully
  support the cliprect; others still need to be updated.

- Two new functions have been added to the timer system. timer_create() creates
  a new "permanent" timer, and timer_adjust() adjusts the scheduling of that
  timer. This is now the only way to dynamically manipulate a timer. The old
  functions timer_set() and timer_pulse() are still around, but they no longer
  return a handle to the timer they create. Timers created with timer_create()
  should be created at initialization time, not dynamically. Timers also now
  participate in the automatic resource tracking, so there is no need to
  explicitly dispose of them. All existing drivers have been updated with the
  necessary changes.

- Basic generic NVRAM handlers have been added. For a number of games, it is
  sufficient to point the global variables 'generic_nvram' and
  'generic_nvram_size' to the location and size of the NVRAM area. In the
  machine driver, you can now specify 'generic_0fill' or 'generic_1fill' to
  request a generic NVRAM handler. The 0fill and 1fill refer to how the memory
  is initialized in the absence of an .nv file.

- The following old functions and macros have now been fully deprecated:

     cpu_get_pc()           -> activecpu_get_pc()
     cpu_get_sp()           -> activecpu_get_sp()
     cpu_getpreviouspc()    -> activecpu_get_previouspc()
     cpu_get_reg()          -> activecpu_get_reg()
     cpu_set_reg()          -> activecpu_set_reg()
     cpu_set_op_base()      -> activecpu_set_op_base()
     cpu_get_pc_byte()      -> activecpu_get_pc_byte()
     READ_WORD              -> (no equivalent)
     WRITE_WORD             -> (no equivalent)

- New function force_partial_update(), call this to force a partial update to
  occur up to and including the specified scanline. [Aaron Giles]

- ARM CPU emulation [Bryan McPhail, Phil Stroffolino]
