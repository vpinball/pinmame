 Introduction<Introduction>

 Welcome to XMAME

This the the *nix port of the almost legendary mame. 
Mame is an arcade machine emulator, started in 1997 by 
Nicola Salmoria. It started out as a series of 
emulators for  individual games. This series of 
emulators was combined into a  simgle multi-game 
emulator. This is the current form of mame; no longer a 
one-man show, there are over 100 contributors to the project.

 Keep everything up-to-date!

The most recent copy of this guide, the xmame-sources 
and many more can be found on the xmame project 
homepage at [http://x.mame.net/||http://x.mame.net/]

 Pending Jobs - or TODO

If you think you can help with the todo list or you can 
make a  contribution that you feel is interesting, 
please send mail to the xmame/xmess coordinator. See [Mail] 
for contact information.

* Optimise mouse warping.

* Remove osd_input_init_post, add display ready flag.

* Updating of fps is off (dirty marking problem) with 
  vector games.

* Update porting.txt.

* Convert all remaining sound drivers to plugins.

* Rewrite display/input code to be more modular, 
  oo-ish, and usable as a separate library.

* Split -[no]scanline option into emulated and real 
  scanline options.

* Add an option to specify which resolution to use, add 
  clipping and panning if it doesn't fit and use it anyway.

* Use Pentium TSC for uclock where available.

* Network:

  * Fix since the dos team broke it, find out if the 
    dosnet team is still alive.

  * Add mouse/joystick support to network play

  * Try converting network support to tcp, currently we 
    have no error correction.

  * Make network code more robust, version check, input 
    settings check, etc.

* Check x11-joystick. Rumor has it it's broken, but 
  then again there's only one bug-report, so it seems 
  no one is using it.

* fm soundhack for linux-i386.

* Make which messages are emitted and when configurable 
  (log-type's and log-level), make fileio emit messages 
  about which files it tries to open, to help debug 
  rom-loading problems, and walk through all messages 
  xmame emits giving them all a standard format like:

  OSD:        Info:    bla
  X11-window: Warning: bla
  Svgalib:    Error:   bla

* Add scancode 128-255 for non-PC keys like F13 -- F24, 
  more keypad keys, etc., update all display targets to 
  use this.

* Also see the text todo file, kept around to quickly 
  enter stuff while hacking: [todo||todo].

 Compiling, Setting Up and Starting Xmame/Xmess

Note: This section is not a Unix tutorial. You need to 
know some basic  Unix commands to compile and install 
xmame/xmess.

 Requirements     

* GNU make is MANDATORY in ALL Systems, even if you use 
  a different  compiler. 

* On all platforms zlib is now needed since the core 
  uses it. If you don't have zlib, a stripped version 
  is included with xmame. See: [FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?] and [FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?]

* You are encouraged to use a GNU development 
  environment: gcc, gmake, gnu- ar. Lots of problems 
  are found due to the very permissive syntax in gcc, 
  so if you use a strictly ANSI C compiler, you'll get 
  lots of warnings, and if the version of xmame/xmess 
  is not fully debugged, compilation errors.

* Xmame compilation breaks when using egcs-1.1.x or 
  gcc-2.95, use -fno-strict-aliasing to fix it. 
  gcc-2.95.1 does work with -fstrict-aliasing, and 
  gives a nice speed increase.

* Xmame compilation also breaks when using Red Hat 7's 
  latest (as of 16 January 2001) update for gcc. If you 
  experience problems, please either downgrade your 
  compiler to the one included on the Red Hat 7 CD-ROM, 
  or try replacing "gcc" in the Makefile with "kgcc", which 
  will invoke egcs-1.1.2. (But please see above about 
  the -fstrict-aliasing flag.)

 Follow these steps to compile xmame/xmess

1. See [Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems] for platform specific compiling information.

2. See [Display subsystem specific comments and notes] for special display methods information.

3. Download the xmame/xmess source files archive.

4. Move the xmame/xmess source files archive to a 
  suitable work directory. When you extract the 
  archive, sub directories will be created under the  
  work directory.

5. Rename the source files archive so its extension is 
  .gz, so that gzip doesn't complain. For example, 
  change xmame-0.34b1.1.tgz to xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz

6. Use gzip -d to uncompress the archive. For example, type:

  gzip -d xmame-0.34b1.1.tar.gz

7. Extract the files with tar. For example, type:

  tar xvf xmame-0.34b1.1.tar

8. After extracting the archive, change to the 
  subdirectory created by  the extraction process. For 
  example, after extracting the xmame-0.34b1.1.tar 
  archive, a directory named xmame-0.34b1.1 is created. 
  Change to it. This directory is the top of the source tree.

9. Copy makefile.unix to Makefile, the distributed 
  Makefile is used for development and is not a good 
  starting point!

10. Edit the Makefile and change the settings according 
  to your system. The default makefile.unix is 
  preconfigured to run under X11/Linux. Be careful 
  editing this file.

  * If you intend to compile in X11 joystick support, 
    type the following to see the available Xdevice list:

    make xlistdev; ./xlistdev

  * Choose the desired device and re-edit Makefile, 
    setting the option X11_JOYNAME to the correct device.

11. Compile xmame/xmess by typing:

  make

12. If the compile fails, report the problem to the author.

13. *** YOU MAY NEED TO BE root TO PERFORM THIS STEP 
  *** To install xmame/xmess, type:

  make install

14. If you want you can now build xmame/xmess for 
  another target/display method, otherwise skip to the 
  next step.

  (a) If you want to also build for another target 
    repeat repeat the "make" and "make install" steps 
    adding "TARGET=<target>" to the make command for example:

    make TARGET=mess
    make install

  (b) If you want to also build for another display 
    method repeat the "make" and "make install" steps 
    adding "DISPLAY_METHOD=<method>" to the make command 
    for example:

    make DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
    make install

  (c) You can also combine the 2 above for example:

    make TARGET=mess DISPLAY_METHOD=svgalib
    make install

15. In your home directory, create a subdirectory 
  called .xmame.

16. From the top of the source tree, copy the file 
  doc/xmamerc.dist to the ${HOME}/.xmame/ directory. 
  (For xmess do this for xmessrc)

17. If desired, copy xmamerc.dist to the global xmamerc 
  location as "xmamerc" (for xmess, copy xmamerc.dist 
  to xmessrc). The global xmamerc location is defined 
  in the Makefile.

18. Edit ${HOME}/.xmame/xmamerc to match your 
  preferences. (For xmess, edit ${HOME}/.xmess/xmessrc)

19. Be sure that the DISPLAY and PATH environment 
  variables are  set correctly.

20. Make sure your ROM images are installed.

21. Start the X-Window System. (Unless you compiled for 
  a different display method in which case you skip 
  this step.)

22. Start xmame/xmess. For example:

  /usr/games/xmame.x11 dkong

 If you have problems compiling, installing and 
  starting xmame/xmess...     

* Read  [Xmame frequently asked questions]

* Read (the recent parts of) [ChangeLogs]. They might contain some 
  hints about recent changes which aren't fully 
  documented yet.

* Check [Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems] for operating system-specific notes. You may 
  need to do something special for your operating system.

* Check [Display subsystem specific comments and notes] for display subsystem-specific notes. You may 
  need to do something special for your display system.

* If you get an error about gz_open and a bunch of 
  other functions not found during linking, read: [FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?] and [FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?].

* Be sure that the rompath in your xmamerc/xmessrc is 
  correct; see [FAQ: Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go?].

* Check xmamerc/xmessrc: Is it configured correctly?

* Are you getting messages that you are missing files? 
  Maybe you are missing PROMs; see [FAQ: Why doesn't a game work?] and [FAQ: What are PROMs?]

* Is the program in your PATH?

* The svgalib/xf86_dga build of xmame/xmess requires 
  setuid root. Are your permissions correct?

* Try asking the friendly folks at the newsgroup 
  alt.game.mame to see if anyone else has experienced 
  the same problem as you.

* Try mailing to the xmame mailinglist, see [Mail] for more 
  information.

If all else fails, send email to the current maintainer 
of the xmame/xmess project. See [Mail] for contact information.

 Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems <Compile Notes for Specific Operating Systems>

 Linux i386

Linux i386 is the platform I (Hans) use, so xmame 
should compile without any hassles on Linux i386. 
(Note: The same is true for Lawrence Gold.)

Some bugs have been found and worked around when using 
gcc27x, please use egcs if available. If more gcc bugs 
popup, egcs will be  made mandatory, but I hope that 
won't be necessary.

It has been reported that some SoundBlaster AWE32 and 
VIA-82cxxx (onboard) cards do not  correctly manage 
get_freespace(). If so, you'll get some audio_ioctl() 
calls failed messages in console, and if everything 
goes right a message that xmame/xmess is falling back 
to timer based audio. If  this doesn't happen and sound 
isn't right, try forcing timer-based  audio by starting 
xmame/xmess with -timer.

SB64/128PCI cards (Ensoniq 137x-based cards) also do 
not correctly manage get_freespace(). Unfortunately, 
this doesn't result in failed ioctl's; instead, they 
just ignore the calls. Xmame tries to autodetect this 
and to fall back to timer-based audio. If this doesn't 
happen and sound isn't right, try forcing timer based 
audio by starting xmame/xmess with -timer.

Some have reported success using ALSA with OSS 
emulation (see [http://www.alsa-project.org/||http://www.alsa-project.org/]). If you experience the above problems, 
this would certainly be worth a try.

Also, I've tested sound using the PC-Speaker driver 
module. It works!! But it needs -timer. Again, it 
should do this  automagically, but you know what to do 
if it doesn't.

Distribution-Specific Comments:

* S.u.S.E. Linux: Besides the gcc compiler and libc 
  libraries, which are both from the "d" series, other 
  packages  need to be installed or the build will 
  fail. If compiling for svgalib, the svgalib package 
  from series "d" installed. If compiling for the 
  X-Window System, you must have xdevel package from 
  series "x" installed. These packages can be installed 
  using the "yast" utility included in the S.u.S.E. distribution.

* Red Hat Linux is the operating system used by the 
  author. xmame/xmess  should build correctly under Red 
  Hat Linux. :-)

 Linux PowerPC

Linux PowerPC should work from now on. Here's an email 
from Andreas Varga [mailto:sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at||sid@skater.htu.tuwien.ac.at], the Linux/PowerPC maintainer, 
describing the necessary steps:

Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on 
Linux/PowerPC with SVGALIB

Makefile:

* enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc 

* enable DISPLAY_METHOD = svgalib 

* enable ARCH = linux 

* remove -lvgagl from LIBS.svgalib in src/unix/unix.mak 
  (only -lvga is required)

Required changes to compile xmame 0.34b3.1 on 
Linux/PowerPC with X11 

Makefile: 

* enable CFLAGS for linux/ppc 

* enable DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 

* enable ARCH = linux 

Another thing... sound is not working, because sound 
drivers support is currently under development in 
Linux/PPC kernels...there is an old driver that is a 
hacked Soundblaster driver, and newer 2.1.1xx kernels 
have a sound drivers based on Amiga DMA sound 
drivers... Once this issues are settled there should be 
a full OSS-compatible driver... sound should work then...

I can't speak about Joystick support...

The original Linux/PPC target changes in the Makefile 
were done by me, but there are some other changes 
required to get it to compile... Starting from October 
I will have some more time to work on this, and I'll 
keep you updated...

Cheers, Andreas

 IRIX

Use the generic unix arch for those machines that have 
no  sound support installed (xmame/xmess uses the 
dmedia package or the newer AL package on IRIX systems).

Silicon Graphics provides several native compilers. 
xmame/xmess has  been compiled and tested with the 
normal cc. There were some problems with this when 
using -n32 for new style 32bit code. It does work when 
using -o32 for oldstyle 32 bit code. It should now also 
work with -n32 which is much faster.

The use of DCC is not recommended (anymore) since it's 
a C++  compiler and thus won't even compile xmame/xmess 
out of the box due to uncasted mallocs. Changing all 
these mallocs would be crazy, esp. since they are not 
only in the osd part, but also in the core which is not 
under our control. Besides that, mame is normal C, so 
please compile it with a normal C compiler.

Some problems have been reported using the GNU linker. 
It's recommended that you use the native one.

 HPUX

Use the generic unix arch. In HP-UX, gcc and gnu-make 
are MANDATORY.

 ULTRIX 

Use the generic unix arch.

Notes received from Danny [mailto:dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es||dboxhoor@iso.vilspa.esa.es]

VERY IMPORTANT!!!

The xmame/xmess CPU emulators access memory through 
pointers which are sometimes cast to illegal addresses 
- as far as the MIPS CPU is concerned. The Ultrix 
operating system is aware of that and fixes this 
"unaligned data access".

Depending on your system setup, lots of warnings are 
generated for certain games. Fortunately these messages 
can be disabled by  executing the command "uac p 0" in 
the same shell where xmame/xmess  will be running.

UPDATE: The new -DALIGN_INTS switch in the makefile 
fixes these unaligned accesses in the source which is 
probably a lot faster than hot fixing them in the 
kernel segfault handler.

Use gnu make.

Compile with the `c89' compiler. Though `gcc' has no 
problems  with compiling and optimizing xmame/xmess, 
the resulting `c89'  executable is faster on an empty 
machine (read: xmame can use all  cpu & memory without 
competing with other high priority  processes), so you 
can set `frameskip' to 1.

When compiling with `c89 -O2' don't forget to also use 
`-Olimit  1000'. If 1000 is not enough, the compiler 
will tell you to  increase it.

 SunOS & Solaris

There are 2 relevant architecture options available in 
the makefile: 

    ARCH = generic : use this for old SunOs running on Sparcs,
                     but a Sparc running Solaris will usually
                     handle this option too.
    ARCH = solaris : this is the one you should use for Sparcs
                     running Solaris.        

Currently sound is not supported under sunos. The 
solaris arch does support audio.

If you are using Sun's OpenWindows implementation of 
X11, then make sure that the X11INC and X11LIB 
variables in the X11 Options section of the makefile 
are set properly. (There are already entries for the 
standard OpenWin directory there that you can uncomment.)

Of course, if you are compiling for X11 then you need 
to set these variables properly, no matter what 
implementation of X11 you are using!  :)

If you are using Sun's SunPro cc compiler, then the 
following optimisation flags have been reported to be good:

    OPTFLAGS    = -fast -xO4 -native

Finally, there has been a case of the xmame compilation 
processes breaking over the "ar" program. Most Solaris 
installations will include a set of utilities that 
conform to the XPG4 standard, usually in the 
"/usr/xpg4/bin" directory. The XPG4 version of "ar" 
should be avoided like the plague. Ensure that the 
"/usr/ccs/bin" appears in your path before the 
"/usr/xpg4/bin" directory and everything should go smoothly.

PLEASE NOTE : There is currently not much support for 
SunOS/Solaris. If you have any trouble, try to fix it 
yourself. If you succeed, send a message to the mailing 
list detailing what you did. If you don't succeed, send 
a message anyway and someone _may_ be able to help you. 
Either way, this is the only way that problems with 
xmame on SunOS/Solaris will get fixed.

 Openstep

You must use the OpenStep gnumake, not make. You must 
also use the NeXT/Apple cc rather than gcc. Also use 
only the optimisation options as recommended for 
OpenStep in the makefile, others will cause the 
resulting executable to crash. The OpenStep assembler 
on i386 architectures is incompatible with the mame 
assembler CPU cores and thus you must use the C 
versions (Use i386-noasm instead of i386 when compiling 
for i386).

The supplied complier is based on gcc 2.7.2.1 which 
will not compile src/profiler.c without crashing. To 
get around this you must turn off + optimisation when 
this crash occurs, re-make to compile this file only, 
then stop the make, re-enable optimisation, and continue.

On an OpenStep keyboard the functions keys do not all 
operate as expected. Using the command key in 
conjuction with a number key generates the equivalent 
function key within xmame, with 0, - and = + 
representing F10, F11 and F12 resepectively. Also note 
that the ALT + keys cannot be mapped. As most games 
tend to use this as the default fire button it is 
exteremly useful to remap this globally the first time 
you run xmame.

 Xmame Frequently Asked Questions<Xmame frequently asked questions>

 What is mame?

Mame is an arcade machine emulator. Started in 1997 by 
Nicola  Salmoria, mame started out as a series of 
emulators for  individual games. This series of 
emulators was combined into a  simgle multi-game 
emulator. This is the current form of mame; no longer a 
one-man show, there are over 100 contributors to the project.

Mame was created by Nicola Salmoria.

Also see [readme.mame||the official mame readme file (readme.mame)]

 What is mess?

Mess is just like mame---a virtual machine emulator, 
only it doesn't emulate arcade machines but rather 
computers and consoles.

Also see [readme.mess||the official mess readme file (readme.mess)]

 What is xmame/xmess?

Xmame/xmess are the Unix/X11 ports of the mame and mess 
projects. It makes mame/mess available on *ix machines 
using the X11R6 X-Window System (and 
SVGAlib/ggi/XF86-DGA/OpenGL/SDL too).

Mame was orginally ported by Allard Van Der Bas, Dick 
the Ridder, Juan Antonio Martinez, and Hans de Goede.

Xmame/xmess is currently maintained by Lawrence Gold.

 What are the differences between mame/mess and xmame/xmess?

None significant.

Xmame/xmess is based on the mame/mess source code. Due 
to technical reasons beyond the scope of this document, 
the mame/mess source may not compile under Unix. That's 
why the xmame/xmess project exists. Each time mame/mess 
is updated, the code is tested  (and patched if needed) 
under Unix. This way xmame/xmess releases are always 
the same as their mame counterparts.

There are no plans for the independent development of 
xmame/xmess.

 What hardware and operating systems are supported?     

Xmame runs on both little-endian and big-endian CPUs, 
using aligned integer access if needed and is 
compatible with 64 bit CPUs. The current list of 
supported CPUs in the makefile is:

* i386 + gnu-asm

* i386 no asm

* alpha

* ia64 (merced)

* m68k

* generic risc (PowerPC, Sparc, HPPA, IBM)

* generic risc, lsb-first (RISC (Ultrix machines))

* mips (generic risc + SGI compiler bug workarounds)

Adding support for another cpu (if necessary) should be trivial.

The following Unix platforms are specifically supported:

* Linux

* FreeBSD

* NetBSD

* Solaris (SunOS)

* OpenStep (noasm only on i386)

* IRIX with sound using the dmedia package or the new 
  al package (sound currently broken)

* AIX (sound currently broken)

* generic unix, no sound

The generic unix entry should work for any reasonable 
standard Unix variant, but lacks sound since there is 
no single Unix sound standard.

On all platforms, zlib is now needed since the core 
uses it. Ff you don't have zlib, use the included one 
by uncommenting the appropriate line in Makefile.

The following display methods are supported. X11 is the 
only one which works on all platforms, except for 
OpenStep which only works with Openstep bitmaps:

* X11 (X-Window System)

* svgalib

* GGI (Generic Graphics Interface)

* OpenGL using X11 for input

* glide using X11 for input (3DFX)

* glide using svgalib for input (3DFX)

We are always looking for people willing to test and 
answer questions about xmame on a new arch/os/display. 
This takes very little work and could help other people 
tremendously. If you're interested, mail Lawrence [mailto:gold@aros.net||gold@aros.net].

 My system is supported but xmame/xmess gives me errors 
  and fails. Why?

Xmame/xmess should run on 8bpp Pseudo Color displays 
and on 16, 24 and 32bpp True Color displays. If your 
X-Server does not support any  of these display types, 
xmame/xmess will not run.

You can verify your X-Server support by starting your 
X-Server  and running the xdpyinfo program. See the 
xdpyinfo manual page  for more information.

 What is the role of the xmamerc/xmessrc file?

A normal xmame/xmess invocation looks like:

    xmame pacman -sound -nojoy -frameskip 2 
-heightscale 3 \   
        -widthscale 2

Most of the time, you will want to use the same 
configuration for  each game. xmame/xmess will read 
this file for default values for the  parameters that 
you can set. This way the only parameters you  need to 
express on the command line are the ones you want to  override.

Another reason for xmamerc/xmessrc is keyboard 
remapping. Some Unix  keyboards are very different than 
their PC counterparts. To  compensate for the changes, 
xmame/xmess allows you to remap keys that  are not 
available on Unix keyboards to keys that are available.

 What is the syntax of the xmamerc/xmessrc file.

The syntax is quite simple:

   "keyword value"

See [xmamerc.dist||xmamerc.dist] for most keywords. Allmost all commandline options 
can be used as keywords (without the -), use value 0 or 
1 for commandline options which have a negating 
(-no[option]) counterpart. As usual lines begining with 
"#" are comments.

You can also generate a configfile with all the current 
settings to use as a template by typing:

   xmame -showconfig > ~/.xmame/xmamerc

 Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, 
  configfiles, etc go? <FAQ: Where do roms, images, samples, highscores, configfiles, etc go?>

 Roms/Samples

Xmame/xmess uses a ":" seperated rompath to find out 
which dirs to search for roms/samples.

The default rompath is XMAMEROOT as defined in Makefile 
during compile.

This is overwritten by any rompath in xmamerc/xmessrc, 
which can be overwritten again with the -rompath 
commandline option.

Xmame/xmess searches every dir in this path for 
roms/samples in the following way:

    <dir>/gamename.zip             (containing filename.ext)
    <dir>/gamename/filename.ext
    <dir>/gamename/filename.ext.gz (containing filename.ext)
    <dir>/gamename/filename.zip    (containing filename.ext)

So let's say that we are searching for rom0001.1, which 
is part of pacman. Then xmame/xmess would search every 
dir in your rompath for

    <dir>/pacman.zip               (containing rom0001.1)
    <dir>/pacman/rom0001.1
    <dir>/pacman/rom0001.1.gz      (containing rom0001.1)
    <dir>/pacman/rom0001.zip       (containing rom0001.1)

Note: If your neogeo games can't find neogeo.rom, put 
it in a dir called neogeo somewhere in your rompath, or 
put it in neogeo.zip somewhere in your rompath.

 Read/write Diskette Images

This section only applies to xmess emulations which 
support read/write diskette images and thus try to open 
the image read/write.

Xmess first searches for read/write images with the 
name specified on the commandline:

    <path>/image.ext

where path is the path specified with the image on the 
commandline. This way, absolute and relative filenames 
can be used directly on the commandline for an image 
which is not in the rompath.

Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for 
roms/samples in the following way:

    <dir>/image.ext

Note that (g)zipped images are not supported for r/w images.

 Rom Cartridges/Read Only Diskette Images

Xmess begins by searching for cartdriges/disks from the 
current dir in the following way:

    <path>/image.ext
    <path>/image.ext.gz            (containing image.ext)
    <path>/image.zip               (containing image.ext)

where path is the path specified with the image on the 
commandline. This way, absolute and relative filenames 
can be used directly on the commandline for an image 
which is not in the rompath.

Then xmess searches every dir in the rompath for 
carts/images in the following way:

    <dir>/image.ext
    <dir>/image.ext.gz             (containing image.ext)
    <dir>/image.zip                (containing image.ext)

Finally, xmess searches the rompath as desribed above 
using the systemtype for gamename.

So let's say we want to play mario.nes on the nes 
emulation of xmess. We would then type: "xmess nes 
mario.nes". Xmess then begins by searching the current 
dir for

    mario.nes
    mario.nes.gz                   (containing mario.nes)
    mario.zip                      (containing mario.nes)

After that, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for

    <dir>/mario.nes
    <dir>/mario.nes.gz             (containing mario.nes)
    <dir>/mario.zip                (containing mario.nes)

And finally, xmess searches each dir in your rompath for

    <dir>/nes.zip                  (containing mario.nes)
    <dir>/nes/mario.nes
    <dir>/nes/mario.nes.gz         (containing mario.nes)
    <dir>/nes/mario.zip            (containing mario.nes)

Since xmess first searches for cartridges/disks from 
the current dir you can also specify cartridges/disks 
not in your rompath. For example:

    "xmess nes ../mario.nes"

Xmess then searches for

    ../mario.nes
    ../mario.nes.gz                (containing mario.nes)
    ../mario.zip                   (containing mario.nes)

and will also search the rompath as described above 
with ../mario.nes as the image name but this is not 
that useful.

 Artwork

Xmame/xmess searches every dir in the rompath for 
artwork in the following way:

    <dir>/artwork.png
    <dir>/artwork.png.gz           (containing artwork.png)
    <dir>/artwork.zip              (containing artwork.png)

Then xmame/xmess searches the rompath as in roms/samples.

So let's say we want to play foo which uses bar.png. 
Xmame/xmess then begins searching each dir in your 
rompath for

    <dir>/bar.png
    <dir>/bar.png.gz               (containing bar.png)
    <dir>/bar.zip                  (containing bar.png)

And then xmame/xmess searches each dir in your rompath for

    <dir>/foo.zip                  (containing bar.png)
    <dir>/foo/bar.png
    <dir>/foo/bar.png.gz           (containing bar.png)
    <dir>/foo/bar.zip              (containing bar.png)

 Xmame configuration

Xmame looks for the following configuration files and 
parses each one found. Files parsed later can overwrite 
options in previously parsed files:

    XMAMEROOT/xmamerc
    XMAMEROOT/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/xmamerc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/xmame-DISPLAY_METHODrc
    ${HOME}/.xmame/rc/<gamename>rc

XMAMEROOT is defined during compile time, see Makefile.

DISPLAY_METHOD is the DISPLAY_METHOD for which xmame 
was compiled, this can be one of: x11, svgalib, ggi, 
xgl, xfx, svgafx, openstep, SDL.

For xmess of course replace xmame by xmess. ;)

 Game configuration

Game configuration files are kept on a per-user base in:

    ${HOME}/.xmame/cfg/<game>.cfg resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/cfg/<game>.cfg

 Game state

Game state files are kept on a per-user base in:

    ${HOME}/.xmame/sta/<game>.sta resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/sta/<game>.sta

 NVram

NVram files are kept on a per-user base in:

    ${HOME}/.xmame/nvram/<game>.nv resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/nvram/<game>.nv

 Mem cards

Mem cards files are kept on a per-user base in:

    ${HOME}/.xmame/mem/<filename>.mem resp
    ${HOME}/.xmess/mem/<filename>.mem

Where <filename> is given by the game-driver. 

 Screenshots

Screenshots, which can be made by pressing F12, are 
saved as png files in the directory from where xmame is 
started (cwd).

This can be overidden by the screenshotdir entry in 
xmamerc/xmessrc, which can again be overidden by the 
-screenshotdir cmdline-option.

They are saved as:

    <screenshotdir>/<game>xxxx.png
    Where xxxx is a number.

 Highscores

Highscores are stored in XMAMEROOT as defined in 
Makefile when building. This can be overidden by the 
spooldir entry in xmamerc/xmessrc, which can again be 
overidden by the -spooldir cmdline-option.

So only give a 

    drwxrwsr-x root games <spooldir>

permission and setgid xmame/xmess to "games" to get it 
to work. Note this doesn't work with suid root versions 
(svgalib & XF86-DGA), suggestions welcome.

For now use ${HOME}/.xmame or $ {HOME}/.xmess as the 
spooldir in xmamerc/xmessrc for  suid root versions.

Note: For highscores to work, xmame must also be able 
to find hiscore.dat.

 hiscore.dat

If you want to use highscores mame needs to load 
hiscore.dat to get highscore info.

The default is XMAMEROOT/hiscore.dat . XMAMEROOT is set 
during compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be 
overridden by the hiscorefile entry in xmamerc if 
present, which can again be overridden by the 
cmdline-option -hiscorefile.

hiscore.dat is available from the mame homepage: [http://www.mame.net||http://www.mame.net]

 cheat.dat

If you want to use cheats mame needs to load cheat.dat 
to get cheat info.

The default is XMAMEROOT/cheat.dat . XMAMEROOT is set 
during compile-time; see the Makefile. This can be 
overridden by the cheatfile entry in xmamerc if 
present, which can again be overridden by the 
cmdline-option -cheatfile.

cheat.dat is available from the mame homepage: [http://www.mame.net||http://www.mame.net]

 history.dat

If you want to display some nice background info on 
games, mame needs to load history.dat.

The default is XMAMEROOT/history.dat . XMAMEROOT is set 
during compile-time, see the Makefile. This can be 
overridden by the historyfile entry in xmamerc if 
present, which can again be overridden by the 
cmdline-option -historyfile.

history.dat is available from the mame homepage: [http://www.mame.net||http://www.mame.net]

 Input logs

Input logs are saved/read under the name specified 
after the -record / -playback option; this name is 
relative to the current path.

 Xmame/xmess still can't find files/store highscores

Type "xmame/xmess -showconfig | more" and check that 
the rompath and spooldir shown are correct and 
readable/writable. Otherwise recheck xmamerc/xmessrc. 
Remember that xmess also searches the current dir.

 How do I start xmess/xmame ?

To start xmame, type

    xmame [options] <gamename> [more options]

For xmess, type

    xmess [options] <systemname> [more options] \
    <disk/romimage(s)> [more options]

All options are optional. ;)

Xmame/xmess supports most dos command line options (see 
readme.mame / readme.mess) as well as a few of its own: 
Type xmame -help |  more for a complete list.

With xmess, some systems don't require a disk/romimage, 
but most do.

 What are the command line parameters for xmame/xmess?

To see a list of available parameters, type:

    /usr/games/xmame -help | more

Xmame/xmess supports most of the command line 
parameters as the DOS  version as well a some of its own.

See the file readme.mame / readme.mess for more 
information about the command line parameters.

 What keys does xmame/xmess use?<FAQ: What keys does xmame/xmess use?>

Xmame/xmess uses the same key-bindings as the DOS 
version of mame: The following keys work in all emulators:

    `  or ~      Enter On screen display to change 
volume, brightness etc.
    Tab          Enter configuration menu. Press Tab or 
Esc to get back to
                 the emulation.
    P            Pause
    F3           Reset
    F4           Show the game graphics. Use cursor 
keys to change set/color,
                 F4 or Esc to return to the emulation.
    F8           Reduce frame skip
    F9           Increase frameskip
    F10          Toggle speed throttling
    F10 + shift  Toggle idle sleeping
    F11          Toggle speed display
    F11 + shift  Toggle profiler display
    F12          Save a screen snapshot
    ESC          Exit emulator

Xmame has 2 different auto frameskipping algorithms. 
These can be selected with the -frameskipper option and 
with key combos:

    Key combo:             Gives you the:
    left-ctrl + insert     standard dos frameskipper
    left-ctrl + home       William Barath's frameskipper

Xmame's display scaling can be controlled on the fly 
with the following key combos:

    Key combo:             Result:
    left-shift + insert    Increase widthscale
    left-shift + delete    Decrease widthscale
    left-shift + home      Increase heightscale
    left-shift + end       Decrease heightscale
    left-shift + pageup    Increase scale
    left-shift + pagedown  Decrease scale

Under X11, xmame can switch to and from different modes 
during runtime: 

    Key combo:             Warps you to:
    left-alt + insert      Normal window
    left-alt + home        DGA fullscreen mode

Under SDL, xmame can switch to and from different modes 
during runtime:

    Key combo:             Result:

    left-alt + enter       Toggles between windowed and

                           fullscreen modes.

Under X11 in a window, you can also grab the mouse. To 
be able to play with the mouse, press left-alt + 
page-down to grab the mouse, and press it again to 
release it.

 Why doesn't a game have sound?

* First check that sound is working in other applications.

* Check that sound is supported for the game that has 
  no sound; not all games have sound.

* For xmame, take a look at gamelist.mame: Is the sound 
  for the game emulated?

* For xmess take a look at readme.mess: Is the sound 
  for the system emulated?

* Check the operating system support chart in the 
  earlier part of  this file: Does xmame/xmess support 
  sound on your system?

 My sound seems lagged. / My sound Clicks. / What does 
  -bufsize do?

With the -bufsize commandline option or the bufsize 
configfile keyword, you can specify the number of 
frames of audio to buffer. The default is 2 frames.

This value should be ok for everyone, but if you still 
have problems, read on.

If the buffersize is to small, this causes the buffer 
to get empty between frames which in turn causes 
clicks/pauses in the sound. If this is the case, 
increasing the -bufsize value to, for example, 2.5 
should help.

If, however, you make the buffersize too large, then so 
much audio becomes buffered, that the sound could 
become lagged. E.g., you would hear the coin drop sound 
0.5 seconds after pressing the insert coin key. In this 
case, lower the bufsize to, for example, 1.5.

Please let me know if you need to change this setting, 
since I'm planning on removing it in a future release.

 Why doesn't a game work? <FAQ: Why doesn't a game work?>

* Do you have the right roms or did you get checksum failures?

* Xmame version 0.34 and higher require PROM files that 
  were not included in ROM images released before 
  version 0.34. See the question on PROMs  below for 
  more information.

* For xmame, check the file gamelist.mame to see if the 
  game is playable. Just because a game is included 
  doesn't mean it is working yet.

* For xmess, take a look at readme.mess. Maybe the 
  system isn't emulated all that well yet.

* Some games require sound support. If you don't have 
  sound  support under your Unix installation or sound 
  isn't supported by xmame/xmess for you, try the 
  -fakesound command line parameter.

 What are PROMs? <FAQ: What are PROMs?>

PROMs contain game-specific information that used to be 
built in  to mame in versions prior to 0.34. This 
information has been  extracted and is now included 
with new versions of ROM files for  games that require 
this information.

If you want to use your current ROM files, you can 
obtain just the PROM images in one large file at:

[http://mame.retrogames.com/||http://mame.retrogames.com/]

 Why is xmame/xmess slow?

Xmame/xmess is a compiled C program that is emulating 
hardware.  Software emulation of hardware always incurs 
a speed penalty. Here  are some things you can do:

* Try using the -frameskip command line parameter.

* Try pressing F8 while running xmame/xmess to alter 
  the frame rate.

* Try disabling the throttle with the -nothrottle 
  command line  parameter or by pressing F10 while 
  running xmame/xmess.

* While running xmame/xmess, press F11 to check the 
  speed of xmame/xmess.  If you never get a display of 
  100%, you need a faster computer.

You can also try recompiling xmame/xmess with more 
optimal settings. The following suggestions may not 
work or may not be appropriate on some machines and in 
some installations.  However, in cases where they do 
work, there can be a noticeable increase in overall 
performance of xmame/xmess.

These "enhancements" simply require editing the 
Makefile that is distributed with xmame, and then 
recompiling the source.  If you are compiling the 
source for the second time you will need to do:

    make clean
    make
    make install

after editing the Makefile to set your new settings.

 SPEEDUP # 1 - Inline compiling

Try enabling inline compiling by commenting and 
uncommenting the following lines:

    # IL    = '-DINLINE=static inline'
    IL     = -DINLINE=static

 SPEEDUP # 2 - Direct Graphics Access

For a big boost, try enabling DGA by uncommenting the 
following line:

    DGA = 1

Then start xmame as root, and press left-alt + home to 
switch to dga mode; that should be a lot faster, and 
doesn't need/use xsync. ;) 

To get back to a window without exiting, press left-alt 
+ insert.

The benefit of DGA is that it is Direct Graphics Access 
and therefore writes directly to the framebuffer (think 
DirectX versus GDI under MS Windows). So it should be a 
tad faster, unless you've got a really really well 
accelerated X-server, which could be just as fast. Try 
pressing F11 to see the actual framerate, although it 
might be hardly noticable (visually, at least), it 
should give you some speed increase.

Besides that, it automatically switches to the right 
mode and removes any window manager stuff, but that can 
be done without DGA too. (I might add such a feature 
later, since it allows easy fullscreen without running 
as root.)

Adding a 320x240 mode will most definitely get you a 
very nice fullscreen display at scale = 1. ;)

Don't forget that you still need to set up the Modes 
line of the   "Display" subsection of the "Screen" 
section in your X11 config file if you want the games 
to fill the screen in DGA mode. Xmame will pick the 
best mode it can find, so if you have a line like

    Modes  "1024x768" "800x600" "640x480" "320x240" "256x224"

then any game which fits into a 320x240 screen can be 
displayed in that resolution, and so on. Don't forget 
your X11 config file might have a number of different 
"Screen" sections in it, and you will need to add Modes 
to the one that is actually active with your Xserver is 
running. And of course it's not always that easy, since 
you also need to tell X which monitor settings are 
required for these resolution modes. This is done 
through Modeline entries in the "Monitor" section of 
your X config file.

You can check out the /contrib/tools/modelines file for 
a set of crazy modes made especially for xmame in DGA 
mode. They should work on any reasonable multisync 
monitor, but don't use them on an old fixed-frequency 
monitor. (And if you can't resist trying, I won't pay 
for a new one!)

 SPEEDUP # 3 - NASM

You can also try installing nasm and compiling the asm 
core, that helps a bit too.

 SPEEDUP # 4 - ICC

If you are running on an intel architecture machine, 
you could try to compile xmame with the Intel C 
Compiler. Some people have reported speed gains from +10%.

 I've got a dual processor machine. What can I do to 
  take full advantage of this?

Not much. Xmame is a single-threaded port of a 
single-threaded DOS app. Some degree of speedup will 
hopefully be found on an SMP machine since xmame is 
more likely to get to hog its one CPU for longer. But 
of course the same applies to any CPU-intensive 
program. And all the things one would normally do to 
any application to give it more CPU time (higher 
priority, kill or renice unecessary process, etc.) will 
work with xmame.

Now you may at this point be thinking, "Surely you could 
have one thread doing emulation and another thead doing 
graphics to get a speedup." Yes, but there are some 
serious issues to consider. The first is 
synchronisation between the threads, which needs to be 
pretty tight. If not done smoothly. the overhead will 
blow most of the benefit away. Also, it needs to be 
implemented with a portable threads interface ... which 
basically means POSIX threads. In a nutshell, it's a 
lot of effort for probably not much gain. But of course 
if you are feeling particulary energetic and in the 
mood to code, then patches can always be submitted to 
the xmame devel mailing list ... :)

 Why doesn't my joystick handle diagonal movement 
  correctly on my Intel x86 system?

Xmame/xmess uses autocalibrating, but you could try to 
use specific programs to calibrate it (jscal that comes 
with joystick  module works fine....).

 How do I enable XinputExtensions X11 based joystick in Xfree86?

You need to edit XF86Config to enable the XInput 
section. See the  manual page for XF86Config.

 How do I read a manual page?

Easy. If you want to read the manual page for 
XF86Config, type: man XF86Config

 Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling? <FAQ: Why do I get gz_open symbol not found while compiling?>

Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some 
compression routines. Unfortunately, a lot of Linux 
distributions have an old version of zlib installed as 
/usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a, and the new version installed as 
/usr/lib/libz.a. If this is the case, it's harmless to 
remove /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a. If you're not sure 
whether this is the case, just move 
/usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a to another location.

Removing or just moving /usr/X11R6/lib/libz.a should 
fix this problem.

 Why do I get zlib.h not found? <FAQ: Why do I get zlib.h not found?>

Xmame/xmess versions newer than 0.35 use zlib for some 
compression routines.

Zlib is standard on most Unix versions. For those who 
don't ship with zlib or ship with a version that is too 
old, xmame/xmess now comes with a stripped-down version 
of zlib. Uncomment the appropriate line in the Makefile 
to use this.

 When I run xmame.x11, nothing happens---no window pops 
  up or anything. Help!

Are you running a recent version of KDE, such as 2.1.1? 
It appears that there's a bug with KDE's window manager 
that prevents some X11 apps from popping up their main 
window. You can either run the SDL version of xmame, or 
try the following workaround, which several people have 
reported as being successful:

xmame.x11 -rid `xwininfo -root | grep xwininfo: | awk 
'{print $4}'`

 Can I run xmame fullscreen?

Yes, of course you can. There are several ways to 
accomplish this, each with its own advantages and disadvantages.

To enable the fullscreen support, you will need to 
change some settings in the makefile and recompile xmame.

Besides the x11 and SDL drivers, the FX and GL drivers 
are also capable of playing games full screen. There is 
a separate chapter for these later on.

 xmame.x11/DGA

First, before recompiling, make sure you have an 
xserver with the "xfree-dga" extension enabled (do a "xdpyinfo"
 and see if you've got the "xfree-dga" extension); any 
recent release of XFree86 should have it.

Select DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 and uncomment the line "
DGA=1" in the makefile.

Now build xmame and give the xmame.x11 file permanent 
root permissions so that you don't need to start xmame 
as root (do a "chown root xmame.x11" and a "chmod u+s xmame.x11").

If you want to start immediately in fullscreen mode, 
start xmame.x11 with the "-x11 1" argument or specify 
"x11-mode 1" in your xmamerc file.

During play you can switch between windowed and 
fullscreen mode. See [FAQ: What keys does xmame/xmess use?]

 xmame.x11/Xv

Xv is the X Window System video extension. Among other 
things, it supports hardware scaling if your graphics 
card (and X driver) is capable of doing so. You can 
achieve a very nice fullscreen display without taxing 
your cpu very much because the scaling will all be done 
by your video card.

To determine if your video card supports the Xv 
extension, you may use this command:

xvinfo

If you don't see a message indicating "no screens found", 
then the Xv extension is supported by your machine.

To compile this into xmame, select DISPLAY_METHOD = x11 
and uncomment the line "X11_XV = 1" in the makefile.

Build xmame, and use the -fullscreen parameter when 
loading a game to get a nice fullscreen display.

If the colors seem messed up and/or you only see half 
of the game image, try using "-yuv" or "-yv12". By default, 
the Xv extension attempts to use RGB mode if your 
driver supports it, but some cards' drivers are broken.

If your screen goes blank or gets full of little green 
vertical lines, then your graphics card does not 
support the Xv extension and you're out of luck.

 xmame.SDL

The SDL library was meant to make it easy for 
programmers to make full screen applications. To start 
SDL in fullscreen mode, just run xmame.SDL with the 
option '-fullscreen'. If you want to know the 
resolutions that SDL can use, run "xmame.SDL -listmodes", 
choose the resolution you want, and start "xmame.SDL 
-modenumber <insert chosen number here>".

You can add "fullscreen 1" to your xmamerc file if you 
want SDL to start fullscreen automatically; the 
modenumber line can also be used in the xmamerc. :-)

Most problems experienced by people who are trying to 
use SDL for fullscreen are related to the section [FAQ: xmame.sdl / xmame.x11 fullscreen has a large border around the game.]

During play you can switch between windowed and 
fullscreen mode. See [FAQ: What keys does xmame/xmess use?]

 xmame.SDL / fullscreen has a large border around the 
  game. <FAQ: xmame.sdl / xmame.x11 fullscreen has a large border around the game.>

If the game runs in fullscreen but occupies only a 
small area in the center of the screen, then your 
xserver does not have access to low resolutions 
(320x240, 400x300, and 512x384, for instance). In the 
case of SDL, the window will be in the resolution of 
closest matching resolution that SDL can switch to for 
full screen display.

In this case, you have to add "Modelines" for these 
resolutions in your XF86config file and add these 
resolutions to the resolutions list of your display 
somewhere in your XF86config file (you know, the list 
of resolutions you can switch to using ctrl-+).

You should find modelines that works with most graphic 
cards in the xmame contrib subdirectory.

If you don't want to alter your XF86config file, 
another solution is to run xmame.x11 with the "-scale 
2" argument. In this case, the emulator will use 
640x480 instead of 320x240, 800x600 instead of 400x300, 
etc. But I don't recommend it. The scaling uses cpu and 
the games will run more slowly.

However, if your cpu is fast enough, a better option is 
to use the effects "-ef 1". This introduces advanced 
render methods to create a nicer looking effect than 
the simple scaling. On the website you can see [http://x.mame.net/gamescreenshots.html||screenshots] of the 
different effects.

 I only use some of the emulation parts (Neo Geo / 
  CPS-2 /...). Do I need the entire xmame? 

If you are interested in compiling only some of the 
games you, can compile xmame with an alternate target. 
Edit the makefile.unix and change the target line to 
accomplish the desired effect. Using this approach, 
only the CPUs, sound devices, and other chips needed 
for that particular target are compiled, resulting in a 
much smaller executable.

* 'TARGET = cpmame' makes a mame version that will only 
  emulate the CPS-1 and CPS-2 games

* 'TARGET = neomame' makes a mame version that will 
  only emulate the Neo Geo system

There are some other targets but they are really only 
useful for the mame developers who create new drivers.

 Why does xmame freeze and lock up when I hit <ESC> to 
  exit the game or P to pause the game?

There appears to be a bug in the "timer based audio" 
code that xmame/oss uses on at least one motherboard 
that we are aware of. Specifically, the ATX 845Pro 
(Intel Pentium 4 processor) with an integrated i810 soundchip.

To get around this bug use EsounD (Enlightened Sound 
Daemon), found as esd with Gnome distributions, instead 
of the oss sound drivers.

Compile ESOUND support into the xmame executable by 
uncommenting the appropriate line in makefile.unix. 
Tell xmame to use esound by specifying "esound" on the 
"dsp-plugin" line in xmamerc, or use the -dp command 
line parameter to select esound. Also see the next 
section below.

 Why does xmame report "can't resolve host name 
  '/dev/dsp' when trying to use esound?

Remove the words "/dev/dsp" from the "audiodevice" line 
in xmamerc. In other words, you want to have the word 
"audiodevice" on a line all by itself, with no 
audiodevice specified.

 Where can I get the latest version of xmame/xmess?

The xmame/xmess Home Page always has the most 
up-to-date version. The address is

[http://x.mame.net/||http://x.mame.net/]

 I upgraded xmame and now some games do not work anymore.

This can happen, especially if the drivers are in full 
development or some internal core routines have changed 
and the drivers have to be updated to accomodate for 
these core changes. Sometimes a new romdump has been 
made from the game and you still have the old version, 
or the zipfile has changed names and you need to rename 
yours (or any combination of these factors :-).

Here are some things you can do:

1. Clear all the old configuration files, nvram files, 
  etc. Also delete the content of the directories mem, 
  nvram, cfg, and try to run the game again. Don't 
  forget to delete the default.cfg file!

2. If that fails, check to see if the name of the 
  zipfile is still in the list of supported games. If 
  you enter an invalid game name, xmame will take a 
  guess to determine which game you wanted; look at the 
  first lines of output to see if it tries to load a 
  different game than the one you want. To know if your 
  game is still supported, try 'xmame.x11 -list 
  gamename'. If you do not pass a game name, the 
  complete list of supported games is printed, and you 
  can search for the new game name (better use 
  'xmame.x11 -listfull').

3. If the name hasn't changed, check to see if you have 
  the correct romdump. Run 'xmame.x11 -verifyroms 
  gamename' to check your romset. If this fails you 
  will need to download a newer romdump. Also check 
  your parent roms as a possible cause of this romset failure.

4. Read the documentation!! Or like the experts would 
  say, "RTFM!" :-) Chances are that if the driver is 
  broken, the developer has noted this in the documentation.

5. If the above steps don't solve the problem, then 
  check to see if it is a known problem; if necessary, 
  report it to the mame testers project.

If none of these fixes the problem, then try using the 
older version of xmame you have backed up somewhere to 
play the game. (You did back-up, didn't you?)

 Where can I send fixes, bug reports, suggestions, or 
  money?  :-)

See [Mail] of this document.

 What if my question is still not answered?

Please check the offical mame and mess readme files to 
see if that answers your question:

* [readme.mame||The official mame readme file (readme.mame)]

* [readme.mess||The official mess readme file (readme.mess)]

If that doesn't help, then ask your question on the 
mailing list or send it to the xmame/xmess maintainer,

 FXmame, a glide driver for xmame

The latest version of this driver can be obtained at [http://glmame.linuxgames.com||http://glmame.linuxgames.com].

 Requirements

To run FXmame, you must have:

* A 3Dfx card

* Glide 2x

* The xmame distribution

 Compiling and Installing

FXmame comes in two flavours---xfx and svgafx. The xfx 
version is designed to run under X11. It uses an X 
window for input. The svgafx version runs from the 
console, and uses svgalib for input. Both use the 3Dfx 
hardware for rendering.

To install FXmame, follow the general instructions for 
installing xmame. To specify the glide driver, do the 
following to the Makefile:

* Select either "xfx" or "svgafx" as your display method

* Configure the glide variables to correspond to your 
  glide setup

The FXmame executables are called "xmame.xfx" and "xmame.svgafx"

 Running

FXmame runs with the same parameters and uses the same 
keyboard commands that xmame.x11 does.

A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the 
glide driver:

* RIGHTCTRL-A -- toggle antialiasing in vector games 

* RIGHTCTRL-B -- toggle bilinear filtering

The glide driver also adds several command-line options:

    -fxgama <value> 3Dfx gamma correction value

Note that in order to display the game options or the 
fps display in vector games, I have to overlay the game 
bitmap over the vector display. This is because I 
circumvent the bitmap entirely in vector games. Drawing 
the bitmap is a big cpu hog, so you'll notice that the 
game slows down when you turn on the fps display (I 
know, not ideal when you want to find out the frame rate...).

 Common Questions (FAQ)

Q: When I run FXmame, it just dumps core.

A: Make sure you are running FXmame as root. Root 
privileges are required to access the 3Dfx hardware

Q: When I run xmame.xfx, it just hangs at the initial 
game screen.

A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get 
keyboard input under KDE. If you have this problem, 
switch window managers or use xmame.svgafx instead.

 Present Limitations/Bugs

* Antialiasing isn't working quite as well as it should

* Input problems under KDE

 Future Work

* Optimize the drawing code to update only the changed 
  portions of the game bitmap.

 Version History

v0.5 -- December 11th, 1998 ---------------------------

* implemented long copies in screen update

* added dirty handling. this greatly increases the 
  speed of games that support the dirty update strategy 
  (although most of them are older games that already 
  ran at full speed on modern hardware)

* merged source with xmame b8.1

v0.4 -- October 30th, 1998 --------------------------

* improved alpha handling in vector games - now 
  bitmapped overlays do not dim the screen o added 
  svgalib support (xmame.svgafx) o fixed a tiling bug 
  that gave artifacts on texture tile boundaries

v0.3 -- October 29th, 1998 --------------------------

* got rid of extra lines in vector games o added bitmap 
  overlay in vector games to show options/fps o added 
  antialiasing in vector games

v0.2 -- October 28th, 1998 --------------------------

* added screenshots o added 3Dfx gamma adjustment o 
  added direct acceleration of vector games (still buggy)

v0.1 -- October 27th, 1998 --------------------------

* first public release

 GLmame, an OpenGL driver for xmame

The latest version of this driver can be obtained at: [http://www.jausoft.com/glmame.html||http://www.jausoft.com/glmame.html]

 Requirements

To run GLmame you must have:

* An OpenGL implementation

* libjpeg

* hardware 3D acceleration (if you want any kind of framerate)

* the xmame distribution

 Compiling and Installing

Follow the general instructions for installing xmame. 
To specify the OpenGL driver, do the following in the Makefile:

* Select "xgl" as your display method.

* For runtime printed debug info, add "-DGLDEBUG" to the "
  GLCFLAGS" variable.

* GLU version 1.2 is recommended (e.g., from SGI). If 
  you use Mesa's GLU, you may have to add "-DGLU_VERSION_1_2"
   to the "GLCFLAGS".

The GLmame executable is called "xmame.xgl".

 Running

xmame.xgl runs with the same parameters and uses the 
same keyboard commands that xmame.x11 does.

The program starts up in cabinet mode. While this is 
pretty, and cool, you'll probably want to actually play 
in fullscreen mode.

A few extra keyboard commands have been added in the 
OpenGL driver:

* RIGHT_ALT-A -- toggle antialias filtering (vector)

* RIGHT_ALT-B -- toggle bilinear filtering (raster)

* RIGHT_ALT-C -- toggle cabinet/fullscreen display (both)

* RIGHT_ALT-F -- toggle between fullscreen (max window 
  size) and startup window size (both)

* RIGHT_ALT-O -- toggle draw-bitmap (both; nonsense for 
  raster games, speedup for vector games)

* RIGHT_ALT-T -- toggle phosphor trails (vector)

* RIGHT_ALT-PLUS_PAD -- incr. beam size (vector)

* RIGHT_ALT-MINUS_PAD -- decr. beam size (vector)

The OpenGL driver also adds several command-line options:

    -[no]fullscreen         Start in fullscreen mode

                            (default: disabled)



    -[no]gldblbuffer        Disable/enable double buffering

                            (default: enabled)



    -gltexture_size <int>   Force the max width and 
height of one 

                            texture segment (default: autosize)



    -[no]glforceblitmode /  Force blitter for true 
color modes 15/32bpp

    -[no]glblit             (default: enabled)



    -[no]glext78 /          Force the usage of GL 
extension number 78,

    -[no]glext              if available (palletted texture)

                            (default: enabled)



    -[no]glbilinear /       Disable/enable bilinear filtering

    -[no]glbilin            (default: enabled)



    -[no]gldrawbitmap /     Disable/enable drawing the 
bitmap; e.g., 

    -[no]glbitmap           disable within vector games 
for a speedup

                            (default: enabled)



    -[no]glcolormod         Disable/enable color 
modulation (intensity,

    -[no]glcmod             gamma)

                            (default: enabled)



    -glbeam <float>         Set the beam size for 
vector games

                            (default: 1.0)



    -[no]glalphablending /  Disable/enable alpha 
blending if available

    -[no]glalpha            (default: enabled)



    -[no]glantialias /      Disable/enable antialiasing

    -[no]glaa               (default: enabled)



    -gllibname /            Choose the dynamically 
loaded OpenGL

    -gllib <string>         library

                            (default: libGL.so)



    -glulibname /           Choose the dynamically 
loaded GLU library

    -glulib <string>        (default: libGLU.so)



    -[no]cabview            Don't start/start in 
cabinet view mode

                            (default: don't start in 
this mode)



    -cabinet <cabname>      Specify which cabinet model 
to use

                            (default: glmamejau)

 

   -glres <string>          Always scale games to 
<Xres>x<Yres>, 

                            keeping their aspect ratio. 

                            This overrides the scale options.

                            Use this e.g. for the 
Vodoo1 gfx cards

                            with: "-glres 640x480"







Three cabinet models are provided. The default, 
"glmamejau", is designed to look like a standard arcade 
cabinet, like "glmame". The last one, "trans", is a box 
with a transparent game screen.

Note that in order to display the game options or the 
fps display in vector games, the game's bitmap is 
overlaid above the vector display. Drawing the bitmap 
is a big cpu hog for some low-end hardware accelerated 
OpenGL implementations, so you'll notice that the game 
slows down when the bitmap is overlaid.

Because bitmap overlaying is the default, you can 
toggle it on and off by pressing the "RIGHT_ALT-O" key, 
or turn it off at startup by using the command line 
option "-noglbitmap".

A problem with vector games and the cabinet mode is 
that some vector points do not reside within the screen 
coordinates, so you may see some vectors outside of the 
cabinet's mame display.

*** IMPORTANT! ***

If you have trouble with GLmame, or it is slow, read 
the "Common Questions" section. Most of the questions 
people email me are answered here.

 Cabinet Models

Cabinet model information is stored in the "cab" 
subdirectory of the directory you specified with the 
ROMPATH variable in the Makefile. Path information 
specified in xmamerc or with the 'rompath' shell 
environment variable is currently not used. Each 
cabinet model has it's own subdirectory. GLmame will 
first try to load either the user-specified cabinet 
model (using the -cabinet command-line option), or a 
model corresponding to the current game name. Failing 
that, it will use the generic "glmame" model.

A cabinet model directory must contain a geometry file 
<modelname>.cab, and any .jpg files used for textures 
on the model. The format of the .cab file will be 
familiar if you have ever programmed using OpenGL -- it 
looks much like an OpenGL display list. The format is 
as follows:

    cabv1.1

This header must be the first 7 characters of the file.

    #<text>

Comment lines begin with '#'

    begin <type>

Begins a geometry object, where type is one of (points, 
polygon, quads, quad_strip, screen). Each "begin" must 
be paired with an "end" statement. A "polygon" is 
specified using one vertex per, well... vertex. "quads" 
are four-sided polygons, each specified by four 
vertices in order around the polygon. A "quad_strip" is 
a series of four-sided polygons, each of which shares 
an edge with the polygons before and after it in the 
strip. A "screen" is a quad that defines the actual 
area in 3D space where the game will be displayed. only 
one of these should be defined. For more info, look at 
any description of OpenGL geometry.

    end

Ends the geometry object begun with "begin".

    pointsize <s>

Changes the current pointsize to the corresponding size 
value (specified as a floating point number between 0.0 
and, e.g., 20.0). Note: You cannot use this statement 
between begin and end!

    color4 <r> <g> <b>

Changes the current color to the corresponding rgb 
value (specified as floating point numbers between 0 
and 1).

    color4 <r> <g> <b> <a>

Changes the current color to the corresponding rgba 
value (specified as floating point numbers between 0 
and 1).

    shading <type>

Sets the shading type. available types are "smooth" 
(which blends colors from one vertex to the next) or 
"flat" (which doesn't).

    vertex <x> <y> <z>

Specifies a vertex for the current geometry object as a 
point in 3-space.

    numtex <num>

Specifies the number of different textures to be 
loaded. This declaration must precede any "loadtex" call.

    loadtex <num> <width> <height> <filename>

Loads texture number <num> from .jpg file <filename>. 
The .jpg file *must* be <width> by <height> pixels, and 
both <width> and <height> must be powers of two (and 
must conform to the hardware requirements of any 3D 
card you want the cabinet to work with -- 256x256 for 3Dfx).

    texcoord <xcoord> <ycoord>

Sets the texture coordinate of the next vertex. This 
specifies where in 2D texture space the vertex lies.

    enable texture

Enables texture mapping (using the currently-selected texture).

    disable texture

Turns off texture mapping.

    settex <num>

Select texture <num> for doing texturing. The texture 
must previously have been loaded using "loadtex".

    camerapan <num>

Starts the camera pan definition that will be followed 
by <num> camera transistions. After the last transision 
definition, the pan sequence must be ended with an 
"end" statement.

    goto <lx> <ly> <lz> <px> <py> <pz> <nx> <ny> <nz>

Relocates and reorients the camera. The arguments are 
the same as are used by the OpenGL command 
"gluLookAt()". The camera is positioned at point 
<lx,ly,lz>, pointing along vector <px,py,pz>, with "up" 
normal (the direction that is "up" for the camera) <nx,ny,nz>.

    moveto <lx> <ly> <lz> <px> <py> <pz> <nx> <ny> <nz> <frames>

Moves the camera to a new location (specified as in 
"goto"). The transition occurs over <frames> frames.

All commands must be on separate lines. Use the 
(somewhat) commented glmamejau cabinet as an example to 
work from.

 Common Questions (FAQ)

Q: I am only getting a few frames-per-second. This 
sucks! What gives? 

A1: You're probably running Mesa in software mode. You 
should read the "README.3Dfx" file in the Mesa distro. 
Specifically, you need to "setenv MESA_GLX_FX fullscreen".

A2: You don't have a 3D graphics card. Go buy one (see below)!

Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just dumps core. That's not 
as much fun as 3D Pacman, now is it?

A1: If you are using a 3Dfx card, make sure you are 
running xmame.xgl as root. Root privileges are required 
to access the 3Dfx hardware.

A2: If you're using Mesa and haven't upgraded to v3.0, 
do so. 

Q: When I run xmame.xgl, it just hangs at the initial 
game screen.

A: Are you running KDE? For some reason, I can't get 
keyboard input under KDE. If you have this problem, 
switch window managers.

Q: Which graphics cards are usable with xmame.xgl? 

A: We have the following experiences (date 20010713):

* Vodoo3 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2), with 
  command line options "-noglaa" and 16bpp X11 server 
  color depth.

* Vodoo1 + Mesa 3.4 + Glide, with command line options "
  -glres 640x480"!

* GeForce + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 with 
  default command line options and 16/24bpp X11 server 
  color depth.

* NVIDIA TNT2 + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 
  with command line options "-bpp 16" and 16bpp (may be 
  24bpp also ???) X11 server color depth (OpenGL 
  colortable mapping is buggy).

* NVIDIA TNT + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 4.0.2 
  with command line options "-bpp 16" and 16bpp (may be 
  24bpp also ???) X11 server color depth (OpenGL 
  colortable mapping is buggy).

* Matrox MGA 400 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2) 
  with command line options "-bpp 16", "-noglaa" (???) 
  and 16bpp (may be 24bpp also ???) X11 server color 
  depth (OpenGL colortable mapping is buggy).

* ATI R128 + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.1.0) with 
  command line options "-noglext78 -noglaa" or "-bpp 16 -noglaa"
  , where the latter options are a bit slower (about 5 
  fps). 

* LinuxPPC - Powerbook-Firewire + ATI R128: see above!

All of the above drivers work with the option "-bpp 16" 
and/or "-noglext78", the latter of which is very slow, 
of course! So it looks like an OpenGL implementation 
bug is causing these driver/hardware combinations to 
only work with these command line options. The bug may 
lie within these OpenGL functions:

* glColorTableEXT 

* glColorSubTableEXT

Currently fast and funny driver/hardware combinations are:

* NVIDIA GeForce + NVIDIA OpenGL driver + XFree86 
  4.0.2; I have tested the GeForce256 (AGP) hardware. 

* Vodoo + DRI OpenGL driver (XFree86 4.0.2); I have 
  tested the Vodoo3 hardware.

Q: When I run xmame.xgl, everything is messed up.

A: Read the above experiences ... and try

* switching your X server's bpp value, e.g. switch from 
  32bpp or 24bpp to 16bpp; 

* the command line option "-bpp 16";

* the command line option "-noglaa";

* the command line option "-noglext".

 Present Limitations/Bugs

* No clipping of vector games (most noticeable in 
  cabinet mode).

* No preservation of game aspect ratio in cabinet mode.

 Future Work

* Fixing existing bugs .. are there any ? Or are there 
  some unknown features only ;-) ? 

* Optimize the drawing code to update only the changed 
  portions of the game bitmap. Optimizing the dirty 
  code ..

Xmame Mailing List 

* The xmame mailing list is intended to be a technical 
  forum for xmame developers, that is,

  * To exchange ideas for producing a better xmame.

  * To share patches and bug notifications.

  * To study new design strategies.

  * To expose problems and learn know-how.

* The Xmame mailing list is not a forum about playing 
  games (but everyone on the list plays...); so please

  * Don't use the list to ask about ROMs.

  * Don't ask about non-UNIX ports of MAME, just about 
    MAME and xmame.

  * Don't ask about implementing a game. Just search 
    the docs and contribute yourself (you'll enjoy 
    twice: programming and playing...).

  * Don't show your last high score in xxx game (we are 
    interested in programming, and then playing, in 
    this order).

* Copyright notice: NEVER, I repeat NEVER send ROM 
  images to the  list. (But you can tell us where to 
  retrieve them... ;-) )

* At this moment, the xmame list is unmoderated; that 
  is, everyone subscribed will receive everything sent 
  to the list. We foresee a need to change this policy 
  since the list starts to suffer from spam :-(.

If you want to send a personal mail to the xmame/xmess 
coordinator, send to the address below. Everyone who 
contributes to xmame/xmess should subscribe to the 
xmame/xmess mailing list.

* Mailing list:[mailto:Xmame-request@toybox.twisted.org.uk||Xmame-request@toybox.twisted.org.uk]

* Xmame/xmess coordinator: [mailto:gold@aros.net||gold@aros.net]

That's all. Enjoy xmame!
