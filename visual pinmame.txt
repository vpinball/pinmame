What is it?
-----------

Visual PinMAME is a totally new emulation project which is based on the current 
PinMAME source code. If you're new to PinMAME, check out the included pinmame.txt file.

Visual PinMAME is a Windows COM object which can be controlled by scripting languages 
such as Visual Basic Script. This allows other programs to 'control' Visual PinMAME. 

As an example, users can program their own front end for it, using Visual Basic, 
or even an HTML front end. 

Any software that has VBS support and can create COM objects can interact and control 
Visual PinMAME. 

Control of Visual PinMAME includes setting which game to play, 
setting options for controlling gameplay, setting & reading the state of switches 
programmatically during gameplay, receiving programmatic information regarding the 
state of the lamp matrix and the solenoid matrix during gameplay.


What does it do?
----------------
 It allows programmers to control PinMAME emulation. Essentially PinMAME is entirely 
encapsulated into the Visual PinMAME object. Practically anything PinMAME can do, 
Visual PinMAME can do, only programmatically so the user has control over how certain
things work.
