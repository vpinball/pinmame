- If you execute Controller.Run without a parent window,
  VPM will now search for a running VPPlayer-Window and use that if found
- just before the VPM window becomes visible it is checked if the parent window is present and visible. If it's
  not visible VPM will wait until it becomse visible (or a timeout of one second times out). Once the
  parent window is visible it will be set as the active and foreground window
- selecting the vpm display and pressing escape will cause an error - known issue
  
Version 1.52 (August 1th, 2005)
-------------------------------
- Added an easter egg screen: THANK YOU GUYS!
- Controller.Hidden fixed

Version 1.51 (January 11, 2005)
-------------------------------
- New properties for the Controller object:
    - Controller.Game: An abbreviation for Controller.Game(Controller.GameName).
      It returns the game object for the current game. It's now a bit easier
      for a script to make game specific settings. You don't have to use the "GameName".
      Example: Controller.Game.Settings.Value("dmd_pos_x") = 20
    - Controller.MechSamples(bool): Enables the samples for mechanical devices (flippers, bumpers etc).
      Sound-board specific samples will still be played (if not disabled by dip switches for the game).
      This setting is not sticky and will be reset to "false" when a new game name is set.
      An assignment will only have an effect if done before "Controller.Run".
- New methods for the controller object:
    - Controller.GetWindowRect(hWnd): Returns an array of four integer values (0-3)
      which holds the coordinates (left, top, right, bottom)
      of the window with the handle 'hWnd' in screen coordinates.
      If 'hwnd' is absent or an invalid window handle the coordinates of the screen will be returned.
    - Controller.GetClientRect(hWnd): Returns an array of four integer values (0-3)
      which holds the client area coordinates (left, top, right, bottom)
      of the window with the handle 'hWnd' in screen coordinates.
      If 'hwnd' is absent, or an invalid window handle, the coordinates of the screen will be returned.
- New method for Game.Settings:
    - Game.Settings.SetDisplayPosition x, y, hWnd: Moves the display to position (x:y).
      If "hWnd" is present and a valid window handle, the move is relative to the client position of the window.
      Otherwise it will be positioned relative to the upper left corner of the screen.
- Controller.SetDisplayPosition is fixed and works as desired now.
  Nevertheless, this method is deprecated, so please use the function as described above!
- The display window can be moved to every x position by now (not just to multiples of 16 pixels as before)
- While moving the display, it made short jumps if the title and/or the border was visible; this bug is gone now.
- Changed the warning message on the "Game Info" dialog:
  When starting a game, the sound processor(s) will be disabled if a sound rom is missing;
  the new warning message will reflect this behaviour.
- Switching from full-screen mode back to windowed mode (Alt+Enter) will restore the desktop background.
- Improved initializing of the VPM display:
  It will always become visible at the right position, and will always be the topmost window
- If a valid handle to the "parent" window is added to Controller.Run,
  this window will be set to the foreground on VPM startup

Version 1.50 (November 1, 2004)
-------------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.50 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- Please see "whatsnew.txt" for PinMAME version 1.50 enhancements!
- It's now possible to run sets with missing roms as well, just as if you were running PinMAME.
  Note this will *not* work on newer Stern games which have been released in the last 3 years!

Version 1.32 (May 1, 2004)
--------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.32 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- the controller dislay will be moved to position where it is fully visible after a game was started
  (prevent not visible controller windows after a game has set the location to a position out of the desktop)
- added Controller.Hidden (bool) property to hide the controller window. The value is not persitent, hence
  will not stored in the registry and resets to 'visible' on every call to Controller.GameName (set only)

Version 1.30 (October 1, 2003)
-----------------------------
- Fixed the bug in the VPM-Setup-Program where the "Test" feature crashed under w9x
- Default synclevel is now 0 since many people are getting newer faster computers.
- Rom Aliasing: Older romset names will internally be converted to new romset names for backward compatibility

Version 1.21 (March 31, 2003)
-------------------------------------
The most prominent feature this time should be Tom's "SyncLevel"(TM),
which is a most delicate and interesting way of synchronizing two separate
Windows applications from one thread only!
In other words: Visual PinMAME decides how fast any other application
running in the same graphical environment will update its view...
need I say more?

- Added "SyncLevel" feature:
  'Controller.Games(Controller.GameName).Settings.Value("synclevel")'
  This will help to keep the Emulation in sync with any other thread
  running at the same time (like your favorite Pinball simulation software) ;)
  This should boost game performance even on lower-end PCs...
- went back to the orange display color everybody loved so much

Version 1.20 Alpha (August 24, 2002)
-------------------------------------
- switched to link zlib 1.1.4 instead of 1.1.3
- changed to use the mame .59 core and most of the mamew code (with some slight modifications)
  ("Not an ordinary change, but an ordinary bunch of work")
- added the 'Controller.ChangedLEDs' property
- added 'Game.Settings' property including the "settings"-object you receive
- added 'Controller.Settings property including the "settings"-object you receive
- by using Controller.Settings and Game.Settings access to nearly all MAME settings is available
  ('Settings.Value("name")=value' 
- the emulation thread is running at a slightly higher system priority now
- the display can be resized to every size you like
