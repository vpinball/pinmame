What's new in Visual PinMAME:
-----------------------------

Version 1.30 (October 1, 2003)
-----------------------------
- Updated Visual PinMAME to 1.30 release of PinMAME Source Code.
- Please see "whatsnew.txt" for PinMAME version 1.30 enhancements!
- Fixed the bug in the VPM-Setup-Program where the "Test" feature crashed under w9x
- Default synclevel is now 0 since many people are getting newer faster computers.
- Rom Aliasing: Older romset names will internally be converted to new romset names for backward compatibility

Version 1.21 (March 31, 2003)
-------------------------------------
The most prominent feature this time should be Tom's "SyncLevel"(TM),
which is a most delicate and interesting way of synchronizing two separate
Windows applications from one thread only!
In other words: Visual PinMAME decides how fast any other application
running in the same graphical environment will update its view...
need I say more?

- Added "SyncLevel" feature:
  'Controller.Games(Controller.GameName).Settings.Value("synclevel")'
  This will help to keep the Emulation in sync with any other thread
  running at the same time (like your favorite Pinball simulation software) ;)
  This should boost game performance even on lower-end PCs...
- went back to the orange display color everybody loved so much

Version 1.20 Alpha (August 24, 2002)
-------------------------------------
- switched to link zlib 1.1.4 instead of 1.1.3
- changed to use the mame .59 core and most of the mamew code (with some slight modifications)
  ("Not an ordinary change, but an ordinary bunch of work")
- added the 'Controller.ChangedLEDs' property
- added 'Game.Settings' property including the "settings"-object you receive
- added 'Controller.Settings property including the "settings"-object you receive
- by using Controller.Settings and Game.Settings access to nearly all MAME settings is available
  ('Settings.Value("name")=value' 
- the emulation thread is running at a slightly higher system priority now
- the display can be resized to every size you like
